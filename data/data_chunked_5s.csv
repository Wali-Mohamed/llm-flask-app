44,For natural hot springs you need geothermal activity.. Best Poland can do is banya in the woods.. I guess this depends on the quality of the RO filter.. Scientists use the highest quality of RO devices that make perfect pure water when they need some for their experiments.. But commercially available are cheaper and aren't as efficient at removing stuff in the water.,5,63
45,"Anyway I don't think even a perfect RO device is a good idea since it also remove all the minerals in the water in addition to the toxins.. I agree with this, that‚Äôs why I said I like RawMeatExperiment‚Äôs approach and how he‚Äôs just telling people to do what they want but sort of leading by example and showing them they can eat raw meat and become healthierAnd it‚Äôs something anybody can do with minimal equipment and no production qualityIf he‚Äôs not making that much money yet I‚Äôm sure you at least meet a lot of like minded people along the way and help some people Thank you Anyone here from Java (#Indonesia)?. Yes but the question is there anyone who is skilled enough to actually assess a person's changing chemsitry and give good nutrition recomendations?. As we all know, even something as simple as saying to ""drink lots of water"" can be very harmful and damage nutrition and the body.. I guess what I'm saying is that I think it would be hard to give advice for lots of people on a platform when people watching you may be fragile and need specific remedies.",5,195
46,"And that it would take a person a long time to become good at assessing what may be needed for specific people GastritisA: Gastritis happens a lot of times when you have gas.. You have toxins that dump into the intestinal wall and there‚Äôs not enough mucus to harness them - in the mucus lining.. It‚Äôs almost always in people who are too thin, especially when you have Crohn‚Äôs disease or any kind of inflammatory bowel system.. They don‚Äôt create mucus properly, enough to protect the lining.. So the poisons don‚Äôt get locked into the mucus, they get into the digestive tract where the food is.",5,106
47,"Then your digestive juices mix with those poisons and it creates gas.. Gas can cause severe pain, diarrhea, headaches.. You have to eat cheese until you're relieved.. You have to eat a lot of milkshakes to get your mucus producing properly.. A lot of people have very thin mucus.",5,49
48,"Under a microscope, it looks like a piece of fabric; it‚Äôs layers and layers of woven fibres.. If you can see through it, it‚Äôs not tight.. Toxins and even your own digestive acids can get through and eat at your intestinal tract.. That‚Äôs the worst case of Crohn‚Äôs.. When you eat the proper proteins, everything is so tight nothing can get through.",5,62
49,"You‚Äôve sometimes got 80 layers of these mucus fibres protecting your intestines, especially if you‚Äôre a sick person - you should have a lot.. He probably has a good size.. He has a lot of weight there to protect so he can afford to manufacture a lot of mucus.. That‚Äôs another reason I like people to be that size so they get well.. I was that size for 20 years, to get well.",5,73
50,"Even up to a year and a half ago I got that big.. I had a 38‚Äù waist and I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô 7 ¬æ‚Äù.. I was 190 lbs, 20 lbs more than I am now.. So, lots of milkshakes to create the mucus, cheese to absorb the toxins so they don‚Äôt create as much gas.. Processed sugars eat right into the mucus lining.",5,63
51,"In the intestines, the villi determine whether there is enough hydrochloric acid or other enzymes to break down the larger food particles so the bacteria can eat them - 80-90% of digestion is bacterial.. Only 10-20% is enzymatic - digestive juices.. So it‚Äôs mainly bacteria which perform your digestion.. When you‚Äôre taking antibiotics you have to rely on only the enzymes in digestive juices and you only get a tiny bit of your nutrients.. People get very, very weak after taking antibiotics.",5,82
52,Your body is 99% bacteria.. You take 5 days of antibiotics you reduce it by 1%.. That‚Äôs reducing 1% of the functions of your whole body.. Take them for 2 weeks and it‚Äôs 3%.. They put my mother on antibiotics for a year and I didn‚Äôt know about it.,5,49
53,"I got a call.. They said ‚Äòyour mom‚Äôs going to die, come, she‚Äôll be dead in 5 days‚Äô.. She stopped eating because she couldn‚Äôt digest.. When I found out about it I knew right away what to do.. I fed her custards, with papaya to help the enzymes start working again, and the butter, the honey and the eggs - everything very easily digestible.",5,64
54,"I gave her ¬Ω cup of that early morning, 6am.. At 10 o‚Äôclock I gave her the other ¬Ω cup and she ate 3 meals that day.. Cooked of course, but she ate 3 meals.. ?. She wouldn‚Äôt eat the papaya the next day, because the butter was too much for her, because of the damage from the antibiotics so I gave her ¬Ω cup of papaya every day.",5,69
55,She ate 3 meals a day.. She recovered.. She‚Äôs still alive at 91 and she was meant to die from that years ago.. So you see what antibiotics can do.. The major part of the body is bacteria.,5,38

58,"Do we know how Aajonus was able to do autopsies?. same it's lovely Milk I leave outside is I really like k√©fir taste Bathing in that atm And the quote doesn't appear Its not like we would be promoting anything outside of the diet, and legally we are only diagnosing toxicity not prescribing medicine or diagnosing illnesses However, if we got a lot more people producing primal food products like dairy, cheese, honey - that would be great Here's the problem from my perspective.. Successful buisiness in a lot of ways hinges on stability of processes, but in dealing with the primal diet it is the opposite of stability.. Health and illness can be quite complex, making it very difficult to scale up a buisiness like you would with a stable, industrial process or product.. If anyone were to lead a venture like that, they would have to have a lot of knowledge and accurate intuition when dealing with people and food - like AV was.",5,166
59,"AV says that it takes the average person 10 years of observation to understand how their body works with raw food.. That is 10 years to get a mild understanding of their individual body.. So think about the time, study, and observation it takes to understand the complexities of countless body types and diseases that exist.. It would take at least two decades of study and observation to become basic master of PD in my opinion.. Before someone has studied that long and had true experience with diesease, I don't think they have the buisiness of trying to be a face of the Primal Diet as hey are more likely to hurt people than to make them better in my opinion.",5,121

183,it‚Äôs sealed all the same and there‚Äôs no difference in the amount of bubbles Do the hot baths if you have persistent body odor I think you might be confusing different things.. I‚Äôm comparing mason jar with the plastic container that comes with the blender.. both are closed You're supposed to fill the mason so there is no air left in the jar even when I do that there‚Äôs still bubbles Obviously there is less oxygen in a closed and full air tight jar than a large jug with air you can fill each up to the brim to mitigate that.. my point is I don‚Äôt think his mason jar approach is air tight in the first place There probably isn‚Äôt a material difference if you use a mason jar or the plastic jar they give.. vacuum sealing is the only thing that will make a clear difference The bubbles are just a small residential amount.,5,156
184,"The jar isn't sucking in air as it blends i‚Äôm using a 1993 vintage oster Yes, if you fill a plastic jug with a lid it will obviously have the same effect You're not supposed to use plastic and the point of the jars is that you can use different sizes you can press down on the lid which would reduce the amount of air that squeaks in from the bottom.. All i‚Äôm saying is in my experience it isn‚Äôt evident that his approach substantially reduces the bubbles which is the only way we can eyeball oxidation There are juices that change colour when oxidised.. Like sugarcane juice.. You could try blending it with different methods interesting might give that a go some day and compare.. I somehow lost my base for my oster and the second hand replacements aren‚Äôt fitting my mason jar I didn't realise you were talking about oxygen entering via the bottom side.",5,157
185,But this is unlikely the case as some liquid would have to escape to displace the volume yea I just meant both aspects of it obvsly can‚Äôt push down on the mason jar much.. on one hand the mason jar is sealed from the top which is a plus but on the other hand the bottom side might be a more snug fit with the jar it was specifically designed for.. Don‚Äôt really know either way i think vacuum seal would be best i imagine it didn‚Äôt exist when aaj was around I highly doubt a full sealed jar is breathing much as it blends fair enough gravity would be working against it from the bottom anyway In city‚Äôs is it More detox..

189,"You could try blending it, but you'd have to mix water and there would be no way to separate the cream from the water, so you would end up with watered down cream.. Plus the blender itself would oxidize the hell out of it in the process so many of the nutrients would be destroyed in the process.. The only thing I could think of where you weren't destroying nutrients would be to shred the meat in a food processor and try to press it that way, but the force you would have to use would likely tear cheese cloth, so you would have to get ahold of stainless steel screens (or other metal screens or strainers that won't contaminate the meat) and use weights to press it into the screens and figure out how to catch the cream as it comes out the other side..

It could have been from too many x-rays, too many pollutants in the body, chemicals ‚Äì anything that destroys the body‚Äôs ability to reproduce cells, to build new cells.. The body can call out cells from other areas and deliver them to that area as scar tissue; as live cells ‚Äì like in endometriosis.. Those people who have liver spots ‚Äì those are liver cells on the skin.",5,106

If your body can no longer have those particular hormones to call the cells out of other areas to go to that area to repair that one spot, you have got a problem with psoriasis ‚Äì inability to heal wounds..

417,"Lots of fats are necessary and meats are necessary to correct it.. Eczema is similar?. Eczema is a fungus, psoriasis is partially fungus.. They will live and they are contagious if you have the elements that it wants to feed on in you're skin .. So it could be from that but you.",5,53

Would say actually maximum 5 years I'm not sure if childhood trauma is a toxin you can detox or if you need to address it in other, non biochemical ways But that also depends on the individual Its environmental and out of your control Is the problem really Messages like this Anything that is internal is fixed It's like 0 ppl actually follow the diet the amount of time they say they did ""Ahh yeah some times no juice, sometimes ate cooked, sometimes salt, sometimes no milk, sometimes no cheese"" sometimes no this and that Yeah it requires genuine commitment Yeah theres that variable too The fact that you are switching in and out of diets and stressing out your bodt Body For sure it's not easy I see what you mean though Easily Obviously lol He said hes not strict so hard to really gauge it I see Anyone have any home made mouth wash recomendations?. 1 cup of filtered water4 teaspoons of baking soda4 drops of tea tree essential oil4 drops of peppermint essential oil I might try this Another research paper showing tests for radioactive elements like uranium and radon in Italian water brands including very high levels in san pelligrino Never feel the need for mouth wash or anything when consuming all raw..

486,"I eat all raw and my gut is still a bit messed up and my breath is rough I dont digest any food all the way, including raw and that causes bad breath and unfortunate toilet experiences unless u want me to fast all of work Interesting, thanks for sharing, so this is according to Saladino's research?. No, Saladino is just sharing and analyzing the research of german and italian scientists.. I recommend watching the video ""I got an email this week saying, ‚ÄúGerolsteiner got an F according to the water board.. ‚Äù I went to the site and Gerolsteiner got an ‚ÄúF‚Äù because they do not clean, filter or process the water at all so it‚Äôs got bacteria and everything in it.. They [water board] are looking for decontaminated, purified water.",5,132
487,"Their idea is bacteria is contaminating.. I want the bacteria.. So it was the only water that had absolutely no processing.. It did not show any heavy toxic metals, no uranium ‚Äì nothing.. So Gerolsteiner is good.",5,37
488,"When Gerolsteiner started six years ago, with my patients alone, they grew rapidly in two years until they switched to plastic and we stopped.. I wrote letters and everything and they went back to glass.. ""This is from 2011, things couldve changed since then Can you share some data on the amount of radioactive materials in that?. At this point I haven't found water that isn't contaminated Yeah, theres evidence in the data I shared that their water tests for uranium.. So it would be wise to avoid that shit Good thing I've stopped sparkling water recently anyways lol, I'll stick to fruit, juice and milk for hydration like you said That's good, I hope for you that it isn't contaminated like seemingly every bottled water.",5,126
489,"Personally, I won't consume water contaminated with radioactive materials and haven't required much water at all since doing the diet so water doesn't even factor in to my life, and it's much better that way.. Research study showing uranium content of german bottled water brands including gerolsteiner He did but either he didn't know about the uranium or that info came out after he died Last time I bought Gerolsteiner bottles they were with added carbonation They changed their practices?. Hey 495 welcome to Primal Diet.. To chat, tap the ""Verify"" button and then ""Start"": Is it good to eat bone marrow with meat if you can't get butter?.

490,"I guess it's best for rubbing on skin too eh What do yall do for bad breath What if that doesnt work My guts so messed up that I may just be fucked Fuck you whyd you nerd react Milk makes it worse for me Its bad for an injury.. You need heat It's bad because it blocks circulation to the injury and prevents healing, unlike heat which does the opposite Is this Aajonus' view?. I always thought it was the other way around Gerolsteiner has uranium in it.. Best to avoid it.. Anyone looking to hydrate - drink raw milk and raw kefir, drink vegetable juice, you won't need any water whatsoever.",5,113
491,"Yea Just saw this - yeah I thought AV recommended Gerolsteiner?. is putting ice on an injury bears any significance?. I see normies do it Only chicken I can get.. Is it valid enough?.

492,"If u want the best water might be spring water, straight from the source, tho then u might also say it might be contaminated cause who knows who passed there with a vehicle or who spilled oil there accidentally or a toxic animal took a shit near the spring and the rain washed it into the water, at this point anything would be toxic Water is not the majority of this diet anyway How did u find ""eating raw meat"" at 2007?. Through aajonus?. Most likely Unless you come from some tribe Just interesting No.. I was sick and a nutritionalist in Oregon told me eat all raw including raw meat.. He never mentioned Aaj; just said he'd cured himself of cancer doing it.",5,124
493,"I bought Aaj's book because it was the only resource I could find on eating raw including raw meat.. Are u following his principles?. Like the diet Damn Is that u on ur pfp?. Lucky you And if so, how long are u on PD?. Do you remember the nutritionalist's name?",5,51
494,"Was he associated with Aajonus in some way?. I imagine raw meat in 2007 was the most unpopular thing you could think of before social media popularized it a bit in the recent years Makes me wonder sometimes when humans decided raw meat was no longer viable What events occured I'm not strict.. I have been, sometimes for a few years at a time.. Large periods of my life I've been too poor or mobile or needed another option for some reason.. I'm not a detox masochist either.",5,88

498,"37 Whats with the hate?. Its not actually cooking of course but gets heated It gets warmed.. It only needs to emulsify, not melt entirely.. The result you're looking for is a smooth liquid at the end; eggs and butter and honey and lemon combined with no visible lumps.. It doesn't need to get much over 70-80F for this to happen IME.",5,62
499,"If you're worried you can get a milk thermometer or any other thermometer you can stick in the lube that measures around 60-100F, and see what you're working with..

500,"I started in the fall of 2007.. Yeah I was sent a ""turkey breast roast"" by accident when I ordered groceries online..

Could check if you have leaky gut2.. otherwise can be caused by for example cooked protein intake that led to too much uric acid that deposited, tomatoes are recommended for this (can add lemon juice/honey) After 20 minutes it starts to dry, so yes that's more of the maximum amount of time What does aajonus say about gout Everytime I eat raw eggs I get a headache :( It is naturally carbonated by the spring So what about the sink..

You're contradicting yourself bro I wouldn't use any kind of metal and Aajonus always emphasized glass.. In general, it's a good practice to prevent metal from touching your food..

599,"high in minerals Borsec doesn‚Äôt contain uranium , naturally carbonated he said to do it with sparkling water ''Acidic foods like lemon become alkaline after metabolism due to a process known as the 'alkaline ash' effect.. Here's a breakdown of this phenomenon:Initial Acidity: Foods like lemons are acidic outside the body due to their high content of citric acid.. This is what gives them their sour taste.. Digestion and Metabolism: When these foods are digested and metabolized by the body, they undergo chemical transformations.. The acids in the food, like citric acid, are broken down during digestion.",5,97
600,"Production of Alkaline Byproducts: The metabolism of acidic foods often produces byproducts that are more alkaline.. For example, citric acid from lemons is metabolized in the body to produce bicarbonate, which is an alkaline compound.. Alkaline Ash Theory: This process is sometimes referred to as the 'alkaline ash' theory.. The idea is that after digestion, the remaining 'ash' (metabolic waste) of the food can be acidic, neutral, or alkaline.. Foods like lemons, despite being acidic in nature, result in alkaline ash.",5,81
601,"Impact on Blood pH: It's important to note, however, that while the food may leave an alkaline residue, this does not have a significant impact on the overall pH of the body.. The human body has tightly regulated systems, especially the lungs and kidneys, to maintain a stable blood pH.. In summary, acidic foods like lemons can become alkaline after being metabolized due to the breakdown of their acidic components and the production of alkaline byproducts.. However, this does not mean they have a significant effect on altering the body's pH level.. '' Not sure if true or Aajonus approved but this is what it said I agree pork belly tastes much better than beef I'm not a scientist and don't know the details of the biochemical processes that occur like Aajonus did but I can ask GPT 4 that if you want Yes, someone pointed that out.",5,148

On the right Good pork looks like red meat I'm pretty sure mountain valley water is ozonated just so you are aware Especially the fat Already tried that Do u know how damn stressful on the body it would be to detox ur brain?. Perhaps safer from a toxicity POV, but trust me, nothing beats pork belly Does anyone know why Aajonus considers celery juice to be alkalizing when its ph-level is actually acidic outside of the body?. (Same with honey, lemon and other vegetable juices, they all have a ph-level below 7) He likes trolling ppl.",5,119

I don't think I'm autistic because I have social skills and empathy.. But OCD and ADHD for sure are possibilities The diagnoses are kind of useless IMO.. We're all on a bunch of spectrums..

But people who already have done the work and now want to live a realistic life from my experience are absolutely Fine doing the diet 95% of the time and the rest is occasional cheat meals.. And they will not have a reaction from eating something wrong if it is kept a Special occasion and the Rest of the diet is very clean.. Sadly my dentist made me teeth look like the modern good/white teeth like flat and all nice and perfect which I dont know if this is ad or good Guys what did our natural teeth look like?,5,143
663,"Flat or fangs, or sharp.. .. Do any of you guys know how to find real primal people in your area for friends/trades?. Dont know a single primal Really?. I thought even eating junk food / seed oils once a month would cause extreme pain and shit, you dont feel that?",5,51
664,If you have poor Health I would advise to just Stick to the diet completely.. But if you do decide to enjoy something then do it 100% Bro what the Heck ‚Ä¶ Life is about enjoyment.. If you decide to eat something that is Not Part of the diet every once in a while why force yourself to vomit it out as if it will kill you.. I eat 99% clean raw Primal.. Once a month if I want to get something to treat my Self I will enjoy it completely without thinking of seed oils sugar or any off that stuff.,5,102

Some of us have what you might call an advanced soul or intuition that naturally sees through psyops, even when we were kidsFor example, I was never the npc that got good grades in school, defended vaccines like they're society's greatest achievement or was horrified of raw food..

Well, IMHO the first step is to stop thinking of it as something you can get rid of.. The diagnosis is symptoms, and the symptoms are just your body and mind doing what they do best: surviving.",5,114

It's an addictive medicine model, and it won't heal relational wounds.. Nutrition can go a long way towards healing environmental toxicity, but it won't completely heal relational wounds IME, except maybe relational wounds around food..

I also live in the middle of nowhere so it's hard to find good quality food (you would think it's easy because there's cow farms around lol) Paper isn‚Äôt better It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs in plastic when it‚Äôs fresh, if you store it in glass when you get home If you put it in glass immediately after getting home, it's not that big of a deal, just don't let it sit in plastic or paper Asked them Nov 2019 so it's been a while Wdym?.

744,"Now with the increasing contamination, you‚Äôd have to eat a lot of butter and cheese.. I did tests in 1988-92 showing that 92% of mercury in swordfish left the body..

And I started getting wrinkled, sagging skin all over the place within about four months after the injections and exploding tissue all over my body so it looked like I had been in a shrapnel explosion.. What I do to reduce those is I have a kind of sports formula: a cup of whey, a cup of blueberries, 2 oz pineapple, 5 medium or 4 large eggs, 2 tbl lime juice, 2 tsp lemon juice, 1-3 tbl raw ACV, and then add enough milk to give you a quart.",5,147
746,This will remove heavy metals and toxicity.. This is the current formula; I keep experimenting.. It works a little bit better on the vaccine toxicity stored in my arm than the earlier sports formula.. ACV carries those particular amino acids used in chelation therapy.. So why do they use these false amino acids that they produce by processing to the hilt with hexane which is either gasoline or kerosene?,5,69
747,"Even though these chelation drugs may have removed some loose metals like mercury, cadmium, or lead, most of the chelation therapy contaminants themselves don‚Äôt come out of the body.. ACV has three of those four particular amino acids and the lime juice has the other.. So the combination takes care of it without putting frickin‚Äô poisons in your body.. But they don‚Äôt make money if you‚Äôre just going to your food cabinet and getting food.. They want to put this chemical into you - even alternative doctors ‚Äì saying they want to get rid of these metals.",5,97

That's why I define health as the capacities needed to achieve personal goals, since this is how one might average all the conflicting needs and decide which ones to sacrifice for others.. Regarding mental health, OCD itself doesn't shut off parts of the brain; it's a symptom profile.. I think OCD occurs when parts of the mind are acting defensively to relational injuries.",5,95
776,"These defenses are in large part to protect us from socially adverse reactions, maybe true to the present or just true to the past, that would threaten survivability.. So the mind keeps certain feelings numbed and hidden (denial), other activities compulsive and repetitive (managing) and some even stronger compulsions ready for greater immediate threats (firefighters).. The result is a system that's working on survival, but making sacrifices to survive an adverse social/relational environment..

Ghee is cream churned into butter (to remove the lactose and casein), then gently heated to further clarify it, the remaining lactose will rise and is skimmed off, leaving a clear milk fat called ghee..

If they are a good source the clams would still be beneficial though I wouldn‚Äôt eat as many clams as you want like you can with oysters however 3-6, 30 minutes after a meat meal I use ghee for my cooking anyways, if one wanted totally raw, probably best to stick to raw cream direct from a good farm, there wouldn‚Äôt be any raw cream in any stores, or raw butter which would probably be made from pasteurised cream.. .",5,150

What if another person like aajonus pops up preaching raw diet but with slightly diff info He's called sv3rige Then you'll enjoy the diet effortlessly way better than toilet paper You need to find good sources The main problem is SOURCING Raw food, believe it or not, is supposed to taste like heaven I rent, cant change plumbing How does he spread minsinfo Just don't listen to npcs and ü§° like @itrollallcapsbr that spread misinfo regarding this Get  a filter I found out that vaccinated liver will always tatste bad no mattrer what..

I guess Yea but he never wrote in his book or in a QNA and said that it was beneficial to gulp it He said he drank 3-4 liters of milk a day when he was gulping and then cut it by 50% when he started sipping He never told anyone to gulp it tho For example he used to gulp milk, then later he said it's a waste of nutrients and suggested sipping a few years later That's why it tastes chemical, it's leeching plastic chemicals into your meat The only thing I can recall is where he said you can replace bone marrow with butter if you WANT for the body care recipe Most definitely Like he said something and changed it later?. Like he changed one of his recipes to make it better or modified something Did he ever admit he was wrong about something or change something he previously said?. Everyone continually learns and has to adapt with the changing times, once you think you know everything is the beginning of your downfall Agreed I agree I don't think he was ever outright incorrect about something or suggested something harmful, he just had gaps in his knowledge and was constantly learning Yea sv3rige is stupid He's so clueless about toxicity it's cringe Sv3rige says just eating lean raw meat is enough for perfect health He doesnt really have books or anything Do you guys ever think aajonus was wrong about things?. The staple of everything, such as terrain theory and raw > cooked is correct, I'm just saying do you guys think he might have been wrong on the smaller details and minor things he said?",5,309

Could be the feed too also supermarket meat can be really far from fresh The skin was golden and the meat was so juicy The farmer only charged me 10$ too lmao Spraying the meat is so bad, there were a couple of occasions where I bought a live chicken and killed it, and butchered it myself, the flavor is so immaculate.. Probably why I can't stand supermarket meat anymore, I only get it when i have to.. and if its not grass fed or organic can taste bad too its probably that and plastic ill pay anyone $50 who can find it @leclayrom can you show me where aajonus said to mix pre-moistened clay and ACV?",5,201

My water is clean i use his filter formula if the water is clean then I don't see how it's bad I  think for that pinch he uses straight away, should look again man who the hell are you with these symbols LOL No, those were false allegations he was victim of..

Hepa paper, charcoal, and sand how much did it all cost?. just out of curiosity $180 including shipping decent What is ""sun dried"" clay Is it just the clay we buy?. or do we have to leave it in the sun I was spending too much at restaurants so this works, just gotta shuck em It‚Äôs the clay that was dry out using the sun exposure rather than ultraviolet lamps, like there‚Äôs no dry clay by default in the world as far as I concerned or at least most of it wet The clay I buy is dry?",5,273

This is a shameful turn of events and at first I was trying to make it so that we would both just go our own ways, but it isn't working, and I'm not going to stand idle anymore, as it keeps getting worse and there is no hope of resolving it, all has been tried for weeks.",5,126

That guy used to not act like this, but now, he does, and I could not get him to stop at all.. All this disruption prevents these online spaces from functioning correctly, NORMALLY, with just regular normal decency, slows me down non-stop from doing my damn work of providing quality content, so now it is time to completely cut off the people who cannot stop themselves from acting problematic (even if they were once reasonable)..

If you're consuming the clay yes it should be premoistened other than that I don't think it matterrs what's the problem Also in certain recipe it should be pre moistened seriously For the balding protocol He said pre moistened clay For other things he says sun dried, which isnt pre moistened so i wouldnt reccomend pure comedy right there They are two different things so that's a yes?.

I think the butter is so disgusting, there's something about it I find genuinely nauseating üò≠ butter is amazing\ I'm glad u know now cuz u spent 3 days confused you clearly dont read the book lol cause aaj never said use pre mosit clay on face Maybe mine is bad..

He doesn't say the minute differences between egg butter etc, he said fermented milk is the best out of them though.. and that egg is very good as a shaving cream kefir goated Do i still need to mix papaya juice with the clay if I dont have acne scars?.

I will tip you extra) i used to use milk for shaving cream too he said to use milk/fermented milk as shaving cream , he also said an egg was good, and coconut cream was good.. but then he said coco cream was bad many good choices I'm gonna tell you something in practice, coconut cream is so time consuming to make and you can only get it from very few places truly raw, and it's not cheap Gibby If he said milk and egg was good okay at least it's about something else lol Tbh, the reason im asking, yes, is OCD..

948,"or would that cause extra detox @ChrisTranchita I would say no It wouldn't be as effective Keep the bone marrow, butter mixtures all  seperate one at a time Yeah but nobody used Aaj said use both together But never talked about coco cream ok then do that and keep coco seperate nigga you are not even balding so i don't see the point preventing it also its not just for balding mositurizes scalp , good for the skin Makes hair grow faster and healthier https://www.. youtube.. com/watch?. v=whuny39Og0Q&t=324s And mix them Kinda like discord Have you tried telegram topic channels?. or we gonna start a whole group just for this id be bombarding his email 50 emails a day üòÇ maybe humans in the future will find out a way to resurrect from the dead?",5,135

950,")Scalp and skin.. It is to attract toxins so anywhere there are toxins.. There can be more toxins in the scalp and face because there is the brain there that emits a lot of toxins.. People also get wrinkles in their face first because of that, the body stripping fats off the first to deal with toxins locally.. That being said, it's not the only thing he says to use on the skin.",5,73
951,"He says fermented milk is the most effective, even more than butter/bone marrow mix, because it's predigested, and reverses wrinkles the fastest for example (so it feeds the skin very well).. He said one woman with grey skin, and many wrinkles rejuvenated her face very fast doing this consistently.. You are asking where to put it, but you do not have to put it anywhere, if you do not have a problem.. Just taking hot baths clears the skin and if you eat properly it will also be properly fed.. So unless you notice an issue you shouldn't need to cover your whole body in clay paste.",5,107
952,"Or if you want to go that way just sleep in clay mud baths lmao.. Do one night clay mud bath, the other night high meat bath, the other night cream bath.. .. .. you will have the best skin the world.",5,42
953,"A bath is not the same because the clay is completely dilluted in water.. And it's dealing with toxins in there.. And if you increased clay concentration until the point where its a bunch of clay applying on your skin, then you are literally in a mud bath.. Which you can find.. And yes a clay bath I call it mud because of the texture and everyone is familiar with this idea.",5,72
954,"So the answer is, there is no amount of time to use it.. It all depends on your problem.. If you do not have skin problems then you do not need it much or at all, provided you do baths + eat very well.. You could do it all the time if you wanted as long as clay doesn't dry.. But that's not a good use of your time better eat more fat.",5,73
955,"Example if you have a more severe, deep, kind of problem:""If your tendon is not attaching, you have some metal, formaldehyde, chemicals or something where it won‚Äôt join.. Just like an ulcer.. Ulcers won‚Äôt heal as long as they‚Äôre contaminated.. Once the contamination is gone, the cells can fuse together.. """"Mix clay with coconut oil (or olive oil which is second best) and a tiny bit of water and into a firm paste and pack it on that area and cover with a damp piece of sock or cloth.",5,89
956,"""""You don‚Äôt want the clay to dry because it will damage the skin.. You want to pull it out through the skin.. Use at night, all day long.. ""Do you have this anywhere?. If not, no need to bother.",5,39
957,"The complete base protocols covers all.. Ok but what about the clay, he doesn't say here if it's moist or not.. He doesn't even give any proportions here.. In the book he gives more so I will post that however.. However you can still see he says it should be covered with a damp piece of cloth, so that will moisten the clay.",5,63
958,"So whether the clay is pre moistened or not, that will moisten it.. So it should be fine to use pre-moistened clay for this topical use too.. So you can keep clay from drying by having something moist over it.. That is the same with injury bandages, where he says you can add a slice of watermelon over the meat layer and wrap it all.. Now some recipes he gaveFrom WWTL in Beauty tips:""Several times a week,applying onto the skin,a thin paste made of 1 teaspoon sun-dried powered claymixed with 1¬Ω tablespoons raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar""In this one the clay is not pre-moistened, he mentions powdered, very explictly.",5,109
959,"And he gives the the proportions there.. But in another Q&A, he warns about it: A: Basically it's a cancerous tumor.. Q: Yeah.. A: You put pineapple, take a little piece of pineapple over there, rub it on only once a day.. Next day you put raw apple cider vinegar on it.",5,52
960,"Next day pineapple, next day apple cider vinegar and let it eat away at it a little at a time.. What your body is doing is putting dead cells there that you're not dissolving inside the body.. It's just a building there.. Better on the skin than in your lungs or in your lymphatic system or any of the liver, glands or any of those.. Better right there.",5,68
961,I've had a lot of people who've had their cancers right here.. Q: What about mixing apple cider vinegar with clay?. A: Not a good idea.. Because the clay is going to rip the fats out of it and the fats need to react with the apple cider vinegar.. You're going to damage the tissue.,5,55
962,"So just pineapple, apple cider vinegar rotated?. and that seems to be because, it's on a cancerous tumor, which seems to be more delicate.. He doesn't want the fats to come out of it.. It's not regular skin.. So in the book he must be talking of applying on regular skin only.",5,52
963,"but clay together with vinegar are not the only combination he givesThere is clay and olive oil for example as wellIn WWTL under Acne:""Topically: Applying a mixture of 1 tablespoon good mineral water, ¬Ωteaspoon powdered sun-dried clay and a drop of stone-pressed olive oilsoothes and usually prevents scars.. Or apply some Primal Facial BodyCare Cream (from my recipe book).. Or simply applying a dab ofunheated honey soothes and promotes healing.. ""Here also, powdered clay.. Shampoo:""Use coconut cream as soap.",5,79
964,"If you do not want your hair to be so oily from using coconut cream as shampoo, simply let it ferment out of the refrigerator until it turns pink and dilute it with water.. Then wet your hair before applying the diluted coconut cream""And this is the way to prepare moistened clay with proportions:""Put 1¬º cups of clay and 1 cup water into a 2-cup jelly jar.. There‚Äôs a lot of air space in clay.. Once you mix it, it will reduce down to maybe even less than 2 cups and you may have to add a little bit more clay and water.. It should be the consistency of freshly made plaster of Paris.",5,114
965,"Then you let that sit; you can start using it straight away.. ""and then:""Cover and let it stand for 5 days in a dark cupboard.. When premixed and aged, clay is 3 times more effective""but he also says it's still effective before 5 days, it just gets better.. that being said he refers mostly to bacteria activity with the moist clay aging, which may be less relevant for topical use.. it's definitely necessary when consuming it to avoid it adhering to intestinal walls and damaging them.",5,86
966,"yes i replied  this before man, why are we going over it again then just do that before i  read, just clarifying, its fine to apply raw coco cream to scalp like 5x a week?. or it would cause too much detox it's fine ok Here are my questions for this:1:You say to apply the clay/acv mixture to scalp and face, so for your scalp you say to use pre moistened clay mixed with ACV, did aaj ever say this?. Bc aaj says to use ""sun dried clay"" mixed with ACV on the face.. So I dont think he is referring to pre moistened clay for the face.. (idk about scalp)TDLR: Should I use pre moistened clay on my face as well?",5,122
967,"And did aaj even say to use pre moistened clay with ACV on the scalp?. 2:Fermented milk is good for the skin, but it is not included in the primal body care cream, or in his reccomendations for hair loss creams.. How should I add it to my routine?. Should I add an ounce to the body care cream?. Or apply it seperately?",5,63
968,"And you never said, should I apply fermented milk to my scalp (or hair)?. 3:You said you can keep clay from drying by having something moist over it, but if I have something moist over it, it will never dry.. And you said the way to know to rinse the clay off is right before it dries.. So now how am I supposed to know how long to keep the clay on my skin for?. If you want a payment or something I can help you with anything u need cause you spent a while u can dm me or something lol and you can answer it thereAnd to clarify the only specific issues I have that are outside the base protocol are :ADHD, OCD (which plays into some anxiety, and some overthinking/overanalyzing), Keratosis Pilaris Here are my questions for this:1:Use what Aajonus says in the quotes we found, which is NOT pre moistened clay.",5,155
969,But.. It should not make a difference.. 2:You put it on its own.. It works well because it is predigested so it's absorbed fast.. (then you can put more when it absorbs as much as you like).,5,37
970,"If you mix with other things it will not be as fast.. However I assume you can use fermented milk to make the body care cream as a base ingredient.. I didn't see him mention it but yes, you should be able to apply the fermented milk to your hair and get results.. Just like he swapped butter/bone marrow on the skin, the same should apply for scalp.. 3:You keep it for as long as you want, truly.",5,78
971,"There are just diminishing returns, I assume.. Just like with cheese trains it is pointless to eat 1 kilogram at once, there are only so many toxins that can be emitted at a time, having clay on for hours and hours should not have a proportional effect.. Unless you have an rea that doesn't heal, indicating it is plagued with many more toxins, then you can do what he says in the quote of the answer I gave you, which is to use it for hours.. But that's for those areas where it's the most beneficial.. So you don't hair issue, so for that it's purely prevention at this point?",5,110
972,"And that almost invisible skin issue, was it diagnoses by a doctor?. I will tell you pragmatically, you will MUCH more results from the other protocols, from the eating part.. Topically you do not need to go extreme like this, right, unless a specific problem.. A woman had a breast cancer dissolving her breast (a Swiss actress I think, I put it in the Aajonus receipts documents) and he applied a clay cheese poultice there, said it stopped the bleeding and then breast started restoring.. There is also another great helpful thing you can do for redirecting brain toxins and therefore hair, I don't know if I wrote it in the hair posts.",5,113
973,"It's oil pulling or cheese pulling.. That should do much more than putting clay on face for more than a little time.. So you can oil/cheese pull 10-20 minutes a day and that will accomplish a lot more..

I now consider this insane problem that lasted 2 years over.. This isn't the first time Erik has tried to get me and others to believe I did something that I did not do.. He made vague public accusations towards me, accusing me of being involved in the Ring drama.. I told him several times that I had no idea what he was talking about, and that I had never spoken to Ring, but Erik insisted.",5,137

He said all of this with such conviction that I questioned my own reality and sanity for months, and thought that maybe I had done something and forgotten about it.. I talked to many people to get to the bottom of this drama to find out what I was being accused of by Erik since he would not elaborate, but it wasn't until last summer that Rom told me that messages had been leaked from a private group about Ring to Ring..

Joe was in his usual fashion talking about Erik, and something Joe said made what Erik had said on the call pop into my head because it was of similar nature to what I had heard on the call..

I could not find the exact time Joe posted his message, it could have been before or after I talked to Aiden, but it doesn't really matter as Joe would have posted his message anyway.. He was out of control.. After Joe had posted his message my first instinct was to write to Erik, but I talked to Matt, whom I trusted, and asked him what I should do.. He thought it was best to lay low and let dust settle, and I decided to listen to him.",5,109
1341,"Joe and I had many arguments then because I would not back up his message about Erik.. He started telling people in private I was covering for a rapist, and I had people attack me in DMs..

Later I asked him to specify what he had said on the call so that I could make a clear post that wouldn't be misunderstood but he just told me that I had ""made it up"".. We stopped talking about it here.. Since Erik was telling me and others that I had ""made it up"" I was not able to write a public apology, as I wasn't willing to lie about what I heard, and it was necessary to mention to explain the situation.. Erik also said I ""used Joe as ammo"" against him which isn't true in the slightest and is ironic because he himself is now using Joe and others as ammo against me and Rom.",5,136
1343,"I apologised several times, and the more I apologised, the more he would mistreat me.. I have explained this situation according to my best knowledge to several people in DMs over the years trying to undo the damage Joe did despite Erik's treatment towards me.. As Erik's attacks towards me became more harsh, I turned to Aiden to ask what exactly had been talked about on the call so that I could make the post to clarify the situation, but he ignored the question.. Aiden is well aware of my anguish and confusion over Erik's behaviour and my attempts to solve the situation in the best way for everyone.. What I had wished for was for Erik to either clear up what was said so I could explain it to others, or to stop bringing it up but instead he has decided to destroy my reputation and paint me as a liar, and I will not speculate as to the reason why.",5,162

If you ate a lot of raw, never frozen meat and didn‚Äôt even exercise, you would put on muscle if you are in an untrained state.. When meat is consumed by itself, a majority of the protein will be utilized as a source of fuel..

Consuming the lubrication formula with the meat will firstly make sure all the protein is utilized for cellular regeneration, but the nutrients will be flushed into the areas of the body necessary for bodybuilding.. It will help keep your joints lubricated, feed the connective tissue, and help to really grow muscles.. The lubrication formula consists of:2 raw eggs4 ounces of raw unsalted butter2 tablespoons of raw lemon juice2 tablespoons of unheated honeyYou put that into a jar and put it in a bowl of mildly hot water, where it makes your hand uncomfortable after about 5 seconds.",5,121
1462,"You wait 5 minutes for it to melt, then blend it.. Let it sit for 10 minutes before drinking.. If it is cold, it may be thick like yogurt.. How it works is the lemon juice adjusts the utilization of the butter to make it feed what was just described, but if you consume butter without lemon, it‚Äôll normally be prioritized in feeding organs and glands.. It is most efficiently digested by drinking ‚Öì of the lube before the meat, eating the meat mixed with 1-2 ounces of butter, then 10-15 minutes after the last bite, start finishing the lube.",5,100

However, if a person eats raw foods, including red meat, fowl and seafood, her/his digestive tract would be impaired by the consumption of whole raw vegetables because they would destroy the bacteria that makes digestion of meat and fat proper.. If you combine raw meat with raw vegetables it often impairs digestibility of both foods, unless someone suffers from over-acidic digestive tract..

Aajonus worked with them for a long time and a lot of PDers (as well as non-PDers as well) rely on him, such as for his raw unsalted cheese, grass-fed non medicated meat, etc.. (although he is not the only source of raw unsalted cheese in the cheese, but the main one).",5,116

That worked well for a long time, even after Aajonus' death, but the farm has been under attack by the authorities in recent times..

1679,It reminds me of making sour dough.. It didn't really get going till my kitchen was properly inoculated after a few cycle of making it.. I held temp a 80-85F for that culture.. I was just following an old cheese making instruction I got from aajonus q and a about using lemon to accelerate separation.. I think my lid caused it to take long it smelled like some herb.,5,69
1680,My jar/lid was borrowed from a friend.. My latest batch separated a bit faster.. It is my understanding that the cheese flavor is partially imported by the type of bacteria/microbes which temperature selects for so I was looking into holding the temp a bit higher to get a different flavor.. In the past I had better flavor with faster separation also.. I usually use honey  to make kefer for better end flavor.,5,72
1681,Recently it separated into curd and whey when I left ti a bit too long (55hrs) it made a sort of cream cheese after hanging overnight which  was a nice flavor.. I may tweak this to make a hard cheese.. Different honeys do behave differently in my kefers.. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the best but it‚Äôs one of the things that can..

Instructions we could gather from his Q&As, emails, etc.",5,81
1821,"are not super precise, basically it looks like: if you have leaky gut and pain, keep doing just eggs, when pain stops, then can add milkshakes, a bit of butter with honey.. You mean taste-wise?. My choice would be with marinated chicken p√¢t√© or with fermented beef p√¢t√©, or with dry cheese rinds FREE TATE MY JIGGA @chrisltc dm What he say Q: I was wondering how to repair a leaky gutA: A leaky gut, mostly by eating tremendous amounts of eggs and honey and butter.. Usually if somebody has leaky gut, they don't produce mucus that protects the mucus lining.. So their own digestive acids and digestive bacteria eat away at the intestinal wall which becomes thinner and thinner and then, when you even have a small amount of food that collects in an area, it will tear.",5,139
1822,"The food passes out, undigested food particles pass into the gut.. That's leaky gut, then your body has to digest those particles somewhere.. So it takes them to the joints, the cartilage is the second most resilient tissue in the body, the stomach is first, produces hydrochloric acid, it can dissolve bone, but it wont dissolve itself.. The cartilage is almost like that.. What happens is, when the bacteria is there breaking down the food, it also etches that gradually at the bone and it causes 85% of all arthritis and rheumatism.",5,92
1823,"There is actually leaky gut.. I usually tell people to eat 22 eggs a day minimum.. Keep Tristan their that dude need to stop tweeting It's mostly raw egg and juice diet, not so much milk Anyone did the all liquid diet to heal leaky gut?.

Toxic masculinity, a buffoon and human trafficker, and then they want to dissassociate themselves from his ideas completely.",5,92

1880,"What an idiot lol No She's right about it being excretory, but of course we can absorb things through it as well.. I see, thanks!. Sounds like it's officially the first stage of digestion where a lipid chemically loses an electron via some reaction, which means it breaks down or converts to energy.. Since this is to do with fat, it also is linked to weight loss because you would either be converting fat to energy or breaking it down, both times reducing the amount of fat and therefore weight in the body.. If you mean synthetic as in ""Relating to, involving, or of the nature of synthesis"" then probably it's just referring to the process itself.",5,117
1881,"If you mean ""prepared or made artificially"", then either it's reenacted in a laboratory, or maybe it refers to something like fasting, where your goal is to remove triglycerides, or fats, from the body by making your body convert it to energy.. It would just be like oxidised ldl caused by detoxing or ingesting hydrogenated vegetable oils, free radicals or lipid peroxides Well that is just factually wrong because its meant to absorb vitamin D and the fats and oils in your skin create vitamin D i know this guy its not sperm Look early bloomer then i was joking obviously Why not?.

Max temp for dairy is 102F which is basically a cow‚Äôs body temperature High temp as in 40 degrees Celsius I believe that‚Äôs where gg rhamnosus strives in Is it ok to put raw milk in a jar vacuum sealed and into a water of 49 degrees c?. I supplemented with both cows and goats milk.,5,85
1993,"Yes the general rule is if you can put you hand in the water for 5 sec that water is ok to submerse a jar in to heat up the contents of that jar without damaging the nutrients Keep in mind some bacteria may survive or even thrive at higher temperatures but the other nutrients like minerals and vitamins start to break down at about that temp, so you have to weigh the benefit of targeting a certain bacteria vs the loss of other nutrients.. And it is not just the loss of those nutrients, but the harm the can cause if they become too toxic.. Example: minerals that turn to cauterized sharp rocklike substances when heated.. thanks.. i‚Äôm just trying to isolate certain bacteria‚Äôs and yeast because i react poorly to those that thrive in lower temperatures.",5,138
1994,probably had to do with histamine.. so i can confidently submerge the jar sealed without any fear?. i don‚Äôt need it to breathe to ferment properly correct?. i forgot to use my own saliva and i didn‚Äôt put any honey in it.. just plan raw goat milk.,5,47
1995,he is has some got takes tho but he is crazy 40 and an hypocrite Just celery juice alone?. with carrots.. good proportions also tried cabbage juice was wonderful fit my stomach but problematic for my joints aswell i can‚Äôt win The army fucked me up .. got a h.. pylori infection which led to ulcers and i couldn‚Äôt swallow food.,5,61

Then he realised this would imbalance so he researched more to find how he could balance it What happened with frank tufano?. I know, going slow is really hard, especially as an all or nothing person, but with every try we learn üòÖ the hard way sometimes but yeah.. ..

I have it with some milk because aaj mentioned that woman who cured her cancers with that but then I read that the same woman was messed up from all the carrot juice Yeah it'll make you orange from the bile coming out but too much of it will mean it starts the production of too much bile Based on what he's said about it you should be having it with celery always and usually no more than 20%-30% of the juice being carrot Why are you drinking carrot juice by itself?",5,162

But the issue is you start talking about you have problems with kefir and then you think its caused by a certain bacteria, which could be the case, but again thats not the root cause of your issues.. Aajonus‚Äôs ideas are simple, once you start complicating things you will end up like frank tufano nope.. i have seborrhea dermatitis.",5,101

2029,raw with my own disgusting saliva Would you say you have allergies?. i mean the fermentation is the problem because it introduces strains my body has difficulties handling with.. raw milk unfermented induces much lesser negative effects than pure kefir.. kefir elevates my mood but i get instant itchiness and flakiness That's over halfway through Aajonus' 40 year notion Kefir as in made from kefir grains/pasteurised or raw kefir made with your own saliva?. The new body after 40 years stuff is probably irrelevant for most people unless they start the diet young because your body still gets older.,5,99

I'm not sure if it's a primal approved clay, but I'm less picky about what I put on my skin versus what I eat..

2032,"In my experience fresh raw spring water can be a very fulfilling experience and give feelings of euphoria He recommended just gerolsteiner right We have such a spring in Belgium, Bru has natural sparkling water.. I thought AV also recommended SanPellegrino, but now for some reason they add extra carbonation unfortunately üòè You have to run 2 seperate pipes one for the water and one for the gas So these ones he recommended like gerolsteiner these are all ones that come from springs that naturally give carbonated water I take it?. I've looked around never came across such a spring in Ontario That‚Äôs the only one afaik that doesn‚Äôt add anything to the water to sterilise it bc it has natural hydrogen peroxide that acts as an antibiotic - for us it has a little effect.. But he recommended other brands that were naturally carbonated and can be used.. Av says that when the milk starts to turn the first strain that turns causes the milk to be bitter which then sours as the process continues Exactly, thats why aajonus only recommended specific brands Eat cow shit That sounds bizarre would be cool to see a video of someone doing it thought it would just come out as carbonated Sounds like it's starting to sour such a crazy price that i‚Äôm actually contemplating getting a milk separator and buying tons of milk if possible to make cream and butter.",5,239
2033,but perhaps it‚Äôs too much work and not worth the hassle and i‚Äôll be left with skimmed milk.. i can prepare cheese with it but I never tried.. k Is that not the case fr most sparkling water anyway I thought that was for ingesting clay That's too bad but happy you had a chance to experience that feeling..

2036,May have been kept cold enough in the tank vs the new source Raw milk when my local co-op was up would last me 1-2 weeks at a low fridge temperature.. The newer source gets his product well before the weekend market and tastes bitter pretty fast last source had a huge metallic tank that he gave me his milk from.. his herd was much bigger.. came in the morning and he told me just milked them.. .,5,78
2037,it was from the pitcher.. Do you know when the goat was milked?. You may have been getting fresher milk from the last source and it was freshly squeezed hmm interesting.. i do take his word that it was indeed milked in the morning of the same day..

Can someone point me the way, please?. This is what AV said about propolis:‚ÄúQ: What is the difference between what royal jelly does and propolis?",5,128
2350,"A: Propolis is tree sap.. Like a tree oil, it turns into rock.. That's why we really didn't have much heart disease until vegetable oils like margarines came in and hydrogenated oils.. They are the ones that cause all the plaque and hardening of the body.. If you take vegetable oils - even raw - and mix them with dirt - in a year that dirt will be rock.",5,69
2351,"If you take animal fats and mix them with the dirt it will mold and turn into dirt.. So the hardening of the arteries comes from your vegetable oils.. The reason the bees take the sap is because its an anti-mite; the mites don't like the smell of tree sap.. So they will line it all around to keep the mites from getting in and eating the bees wax and causing the honey to ferment or ooze out the hive, so they don't really eat it.. I don't think that people should eat it.",5,94
2352,"If you want to take some and break it down - if you dissolve it in some kind of flax seed or olive oil, and maybe put some fruit in it so it ferments (like pineapple) or put it with cabbage juice and cause it to dissolve - it might help you to get rid of some of the hardened stuff out of your system.. The royal jelly is made exclusively for the first few days of a bee's life, and for a queen only.. It is high in hormones for reproducing cells, so there is a higher growth level.. It will cause magnification of cell division like up to 10 times.. Usually for humans it is 3 or 4 times.",5,121
2353,"That's why I say in the book, if you're going to eat royal jelly only have it with meat or else its a waste.. Because that's where you get the proteins for regeneration.. So the hormones and the proteins together will function; otherwise those hormones will go to sexual activity, or running or any energy activity.. It won't go for cellular division.. ‚Äù Depends on species though and where you get them.",5,72

2360,Must be #2 in your country then I eat raw meat and milk I should be invincible tf Btw my primal refrigerator‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is excellent for making homemade cheese (literally just a mini fridge that isn‚Äôt plugged in) The speed the whey drains at is determined by how much weight is on the lid.. Make sure you have something for the cheese to drain the whey into through the holes.. Leave it somewhere where it can mold and remember not to place the lid on for the first day.. Let it sit and drain for the first day without the lid.. Get some uncured pieces of wood and make a box with some nails.,5,113
2361,"Then make a lid also out of said wood.. Smoothen the inside so that there's no splinters.. Put some reasonably large holes in the bottom of the box where the curd will sit.. Get some cheese cloth and put it inside your box and then dump the solidifying raw milk in there.. After a while, place the lid on and gradually increase weight on the lid day by day.",5,69

They then put a lid on so no air escapes.. This makes the cheese mold quickly and will make it taste spicy.. Generally the slower the whey leaves the cheese the more flavor the cheese will have since the bacteria and fungus will have more time to do their jobs predigesting the cheese for you..

Well Sunday is a ""pay what you can"" day because this farm gives very fresh dairy so thy are probably clearing out their fridge I guess from their perspective it's more normal and expected if you live close to the border to go to get cheaper gas or groceries.. The problem is if I say I went to Traders Joe's and didn't declare the dairy and thy found it weird I drove 3 hours to go shopping and decide to search my car I can get fined very heavily for bringing in something that should be declared and not declaring it So my situation is a bit different because I'm a Canadian who lives in the US and I drive to Canada every few months, however I also cross that same bridge usually..

Just do the best you can in the meantime üôèüèº Eat some cow shit, not gonna say it again Cow shit is better than SSri , what if the cow is fucked up I don't wanna get in more trouble trying stuff I just need to be better this year and the rest of my life ik going to be primal no question about that How would it be fucked up, if it isn‚Äôt taking antibiotics or eating absolute terrible diet its fine Ssri is just going to band aid the problem I'm aware ,but like I want a temporary relief because I'm studying and in summer i may  have an opportunity to work and then I can be independent so i can afford the diet , but ym mental state is preventing me from thinking clearly and pursuing what I sant It doesn‚Äôt matter You destroy the enzymes It's not organic Once I tried it raw , I ended up in hospital But the liver is a good quality ,I always eat it raw When it's available You tried what raw and what were the symptoms Okay, go slowly, eat a very small portion the first time and gradually you will get used to it Vomiting,  nausea and stuff I always ate raw since I was like 3 5 We eat liver and meat raw But now the source is not that good I don't overcook ,I keep it as rare as possible I'm used to it But the eggs are okay for you to eat raw?.

I don't think that people should eat it.. If you want to take some and break it down - if you dissolve it in some kind of flax seed or olive oil, and maybe put some fruit in it so it ferments (like pineapple) or put it with cabbage juice and cause it to dissolve - it might help you to get rid of some of the hardened stuff out of your system.",5,141

(Amen)So in this case it was swapped and there was no weight loss cycle.. I‚Äôll keep that in mind for research purposes The toxins could still stay bound to the fat during that process, why not Isn‚Äôt metabolism just the process the body uses to break down the fats?. other things can do itlike avocado with either orange or watermelon And what happens in the body when the fats are broken down also if this happens to you in the first place you might want to eat more before sleep and to wake up before 4-5h and eat again, that might prevent it altogether üòÇ How that company sell wide mouth but no regular.",5,361

2987,"I delete because Aajonus explains the dangers of MMS, this post takes too much space if you want to post it after can you just put the link under Aajonus' quote:MMS is a dissolver and destroyer of long-term health.. It seems miraculous because most of the body's nutrients stop being fed to the microbes that facilitate the cleansing and waste management of old debris and toxins associated with damaged tissues (detoxification).. Because MMS is made of chlorine and sodium, most bodies utilize it to form hydrochloric acid (solvent).. Isolated and concentrated chlorine is a solvent.. It dissolves most everything it contacts except digestive and lymphatic tissues.",5,106
2988,"In the stomach and intestines, hydrochloric acids dissolve large protein-based food chunks so that intestinal bacteria can easily penetrate and eat them.. Bacterial waste is our food.. The body can use MMS to help the lymphatic system dissolve waste jammed in the lymphatic system.. The lymphatic system is our main waste recycler and cleanser.. MMS helps the body's cleansing system to function better with less nutrient expenditure.",5,67
2989,"However, MMS consumption eliminates most of the body's cleansing/detoxification helpers because they are spent and destroyed while trying to protect non-digestive and non-lymphatic cells from being dissolved by the chlorine/salt combination.. MMS begins to permeate all tissues in the body and weakens every non- digestive and non-lymphatic biological process.. An analogy is: the body is a craftsperson and MMS deprives her/him of all of the modern tools so that the craftsperson must make things primitively.. In summary, consuming MMS causes the body to lose its biological helpers in exchange for non-biological chemical processes.. Bacteria is 99.",5,96
2990,"9% of all bodily processes, even a smile.. The energy to produce the smile is generated by non-lymphatic and non-digestive muscle bacteria.. Gradually, energy sources within the body diminish.. Live cells in the body will diminish quicker in most people who take MMS; cells cannot easily divide/reproduce.. In most people who take MMS, deterioration associated with aging is ensured.",5,59
2991,"The Basic Details: Jim Humble (the inventor of MMS) points to academic junk science that has been handed us by those who control industry, especially medicine.. He argues misunderstood conclusions based on assumption rather than true science.. For example, he assumes that chloride (rock) and chlorine (chemical made of chloride) are the same.. He assumes that chloride and chlorine in isolation are harmless.. He points to chlorine being used on meat to destroy bacteria, yet states it is harmless to good bacteria and healthy cells.",5,85
2992,"If you look at meat under an electronic microscope, you will see that chlorine (bleach) will dissolve and deteriorate meat cells not just the natural bacteria on/in the meat.. Humble makes several false assumptions.. He assumes that isolated minerals are digestible.. Isolated minerals are in rock form (oxide).. He assumes that we can digest and utilize rock.",5,57
2993,"Plants eat rock and thrive, humans do not.. Humble states that it does not cause imbalances like other remedies, but he does not give any credible laboratory proof.. Chlorine (chemical) that is not a natural part of plant or animal tissues and not delivered with other nutrients is not natural and causes blood and body imbalances.. He states that the chlorine in MMS is as safe as the chlorine in table salt.. Once sodium and chloride are combined chemically, the minerals are no longer in rock form.",5,87
2994,"Sodium chloride (table salt) is processed and is not safe.. Yes, it will aid in digestion by helping the body produce more hydrochloric acid as I stated above, but not safe hydrochloric acids for the entire body.. The long-term toxicity may not be noticed for decades.. I won!. üòÇ Humble also states that MMS does not harm the body's good bacteria.",5,61
2995,"He refers only to digestive bacteria.. MMS will eventually permeate all tissues.. Consuming MMS concentrates chlorine and sodium.. It is an imbalance.. If it were a balance, don't you think that the body would naturally contain such a solution?",5,39
2996,"My assumption is that the body has been working wonderfully for millions of years because it knows how to balance itself when fed properly.. It seems harmless to intestinal bacteria because intestinal bacteria normally live in a hydrochloric acid (high chlorine) environment.. However, taking blood bacteria or most non-intestinal bacteria into such an environment would be like taking freshwater fish and putting them in salt water.. Humble states that the non-biological sodium in it will dilute and be harmless.. Any sodium that is NOT in a biological solution with other nutrients is destructive.",5,93
2997,"Pure sodium is an explosive more volatile than nitroglycerin.. Anyone who has a hard time conceiving that salt is an explosive, I suggest you watch this video where salt is sprinkled on DEAD frog legs: http://www.. youtube.. com/watch?. v=2YZJt_Bw3eo.",5,39
2998,"(How Stuff Works explained it as:""Because these are fresh frog legs, the cells inside them are all still intact.. The biochemicalmachinery still functions.. There is still a source of energy for the muscles in the form ofunused ATP molecules stored in the cells.. All that the muscles need is something to activatethem and they can still contract and relax (until they run out of ATP or something else shutsdown the biochemical machinery.. ""After reading that ""scientific"" babble, consider that, in a video by the same fellows on a skinned frog leg prepared at the same time, they sprinkled 3 times more pepper on the leg as they did salt, yet there were only 2 twitches.",5,115
2999,"The twitches were because there was a little salt in the pepper.. With pure salt applied, they twitched for about 20 minutes, until the sodium was spent.. Additionally, sprinkling calcium, potassium and phosphorus separately did not cause twitching, only the table salt.. )It is possible for anyone to test the effects of MMS with 2 good electronic microscopes in a 98 degree F.. high-humidity room.",5,65
3000,The person tested should not have consumed MMS for at least 45 days.. Rub some MMS on a fingertip and prick that fingertip to extract 2 drops of blood.. Spread the blood gently on a thin glass plate (slide).. Prick a finger that did not come in contact with MMS and also spread the blood gently on a glass slide.. Watch and compare what happens to the blood cells in both situations.,5,72
3001,"In the non-MMS-exposed blood, there is no panic, just a slow acceptance of the death that ensues when blood is exposed to oxygen out of the blood stream..

3013,I would say that there are quite a few factors that are important.. 1.. Using rennet has time benefit for sure especially for those who make a large amount of cheese at one time.. Imagine having 100-200 litres of milk at once and having to wait it naturally clabbered.. 2.,5,50
3014,If we take a relatively small amount of milk and don't skim it rennet isn't necessary.. 3.. Rennet helps to regulate sourness.. If you aren't an experienced cheesemaker and clabber your milk on the window ceiling you can oversit it and it will develop too many unnecessary bacteria which can make the further cheese sour or bitter or molded and all kind if surprise.. Especially if you can't control the temperature and humidity of the place it's kept in.,5,79
3015,4.. We can't say rennet is bad.. Rennet has been used by people for centuries and if it has natural origin it only helps.. Using natural rennet doesn't mean you have to heat the milk.. Rennet can be used in fresh warm or room temperature milk as well.,5,48
3016,"5.. As for taste in my experience it's influenced more by the quality of milk, food of the animal it was given by, aging conditions, attention and experience of the person who makes the cheese more than by rennet..

A: Propolis is tree sap.. Like a tree oil, it turns into rock.. That's why we really didn't have much heart disease until vegetable oils like margarines came in and hydrogenated oils.",5,153
3266,They are the ones that cause all the plaque and hardening of the body.. If you take vegetable oils - even raw - and mix them with dirt - in a year that dirt will be rock.. If you take animal fats and mix them with the dirt it will mold and turn into dirt.. So the hardening of the arteries comes from your vegetable oils.. The reason the bees take the sap is because its an anti-mite; the mites don't like the smell of tree sap.,5,87
3267,"So they will line it all around to keep the mites from getting in and eating the bees wax and causing the honey to ferment or ooze out the hive, so they don't really eat it.. I don't think that people should eat it.. If you want to take some and break it down - if you dissolve it in some kind of flax seed or olive oil, and maybe put some fruit in it so it ferments (like pineapple) or put it with cabbage juice and cause it to dissolve - it might help you to get rid of some of the hardened stuff out of your system.. The royal jelly is made exclusively for the first few days of a bee's life, and for a queen only.. It is high in hormones for reproducing cells, so there is a higher growth level.",5,144
3268,"It will cause magnification of cell division like up to 10 times.. Usually for humans it is 3 or 4 times.. That's why I say in the book, if you're going to eat royal jelly only have it with meat or else its a waste.. Because that's where you get the proteins for regeneration.. So the hormones and the proteins together will function; otherwise those hormones will go to sexual activity, or running or any energy activity.",5,77

I believe all state laws say that if you are one of those entities, your operations must be open to inspection at all reasonable times during business hours, and once inspected, if they find anything they don't like, they can shut you down until you comply.. This is why Aajonus originally had them under a lease where his organization, Right to Choose Healthy Foods, leased his entire farm and had 100% rights to all the products produced..

As far as I know that‚Äôs a mainstream science belief that has to do with humans evolving to a new stage I don‚Äôt see where else he would‚Äôve gotten that idea from If you are not hungry then don't eat its quite simple to be fair Supposedly human brains tripled in size over 2 million years, why would they grow over a couple of generations?",5,171

This toxicity causes a significant increase in disease and degeneration, and shortening our lifespan.. Fat is the main thing to dissolve, surround, bind to, and enable the expelling of those toxins.. A single molecule of mercury could require 50 to 200 fat cells to eliminate from the body.. So we do not need that much fat to provide energy, however, since most of the raw fat we eat goes to handle toxins, we need that much more of it daily.",5,104

Even then you‚Äôd just eat more fat and juice Yeah it can be harsh because that fuzzy mold (the mycelium) eats dead root canals in nature and in our body it eats dear nerve networks, so you feel these sort of gaps appearing and you need to eat enough meat otherwise it can really leave gaps and create cysts, then the meat creates new nerve tissuejust have to keep up basically and it can be debilitating for 1-2 days I guess if I ate the fuzzy bit of mold it would cause like a really harsh detoxing process?. So it would be better to eat a little Whats the best food to grow mold on also any specifics on how to do it?.

3516,"As much as toxic and dangerous than regular vaccines, but not more toxic and more dangerous.. ""mARN technology"" is just one more layer of bullshit on top of the vaccines bullshit.. Science doesn't really understand how ADN and mARN work, ""mARN technology"" is just marketing coming from big pharma.. Aajonus didn't speak of this since he wasn't around but these should be universal what you would use for any foreign objets which is raw fats, and solvents (pretty much everything in the sports formula), plenty of minerals (oysters, cheese with honey) Hears bromelain and NAC do that Detoxing from spike proteins and covid vaccines?. There is even a vacuum juicer doing it for many months already.",5,116
3517,highly recommend it.. This is an interesting thing to explore Best is indeed to transfer it to porcelain or glass How about the GMO salmon?. Probably everybody that has been injected has patented DNA now.. and for the celery juice I highly recommend storing it in vacuum glass jars.. otherwise the nutrients oxidize very quickly.,5,55

3519,"So what instead?. Cast iron of course not teflon pans Wuth cast iron you can even cook on the fire in the woodü§≠üòÅ RULE #4 OF THE PRIMAL DIETDrink enough raw celery juice.. Only celery juice can protect your body from certain toxins that will otherwise continuously damage you: it is the irreplaceable main remedy.. The Primal Diet emphasizes the consumption of celery juice and that is the main thing that separates it from so-called ""raw carnivore"" diets.. Aajonus agrees that we are a predominantly carnivore species and are meant to eat mostly raw flesh as our diet.",5,98
3520,"However he notes that from his observations of carnivores, they occasionally chew on some leaves.. Why is that?. He states it is not a coincidence or mistake, but done with a purpose: it acts as a remedy to them.. There are some compounds only found in plant juice that will help the body remove certain toxins.. Carnivores only need a few drops to balance themselves.",5,65
3521,"In our case, since we have accumulated much more toxicity from our environment, the amount of such plant remedy we need is significantly higher.. Otherwise, many of those toxins will remain in our body and continuously damage it.. Aajonus recommends an average of 4 cups a day (2 cups would be the bare minimum).. The required amount can vary importantly per individual, it could be more.. Note: Celery MUST be organic, celery can be one of the most sprayed vegetables, non-organic celery juice could cause more damage than it helps you.",5,91
3522,"The only known replacements for celery juice are sugar cane juice and unripe (green, hard) papaya juice, if you cannot find celery.. https://www.. instagram.. com/aajonusbasics/reel/C6cRX4Koygj/ üòç primal fridge @leclayrom you know if it‚Äôs plastic or it‚Äôs ok?.

What do you think, aajonus said cooked fat has 10 times the size of raw fat , cooked fat cause atherosclerosis or just toxins and vegetal oils are the cause?. So the problem from cooked SAT fats are the toxins not the plaque Aajonus says that eating too much bell pepper can cause very intense neurological detox.. He says to have very small amounts I mean i cant eat raw fat on social meetings ofc raw IS better but if i have no alternative isnt thst bad as vegetal oils?",5,180
3524,"No.. Saturated animal fat being harmful is mostly myth The problem is plant fats.. Oils from vegetables Thats i thought, saturated fat just cover calcium plaques for protect heart and arteries This part here seems to be my weak point but quite honestly from what I see online this area is spine and thyroid which I dont think I have any problem with but maybe im wrong or iridology is bullshit in itself quite honestly seeing one maybe would help That is fuck all, and that is your intestinal lining barely anything else You got crohns ring And you might have a lot of toxicity and degeneration in areas but have no symptoms if you have good basic health, later in life you will have big issues there though I heard aajonus said muscle meat safe but idk about the fat Yeah that would make sense Personally had no problems with it yet The same should by my logic also imply to egg shells and so I wanna see if I notice any bone mass increases or anything in particular by eating egg shell powder with mixed in honey Now its this hazel green after vaccines prolly Primal Diet chat: My cucumber tastes like ass.. Help.. I laugh too hard at these comments sometimes ü§£ Not MY cucumber specifically.",5,219
3525,"ALL cucumbers üò´ Gonna do a little experiment with egg shells Ao the theory is that they are just like cheese enzymeless and full of minerals especially calcium which your body uses as its main mineral to bind to toxins and it does work in a detoxyfying manner just like raw cheese However if you mix the raw cheese with honey you can instead of detoxyfying absorb all of the nutrients from the cheese by adding enzymes from honey Most iris‚Äôs i read i see lots of degeneration but little symptoms in younger people generally It tastes delicious as hell the consistency of a pudding I read somewhere that Aajonus recommended that if you want to eat eggshells, you need to soak them for several days.. But I don‚Äôt remember what exactly.. Possibly in milk IS raw meat from supermarket safe?. On my city i cant find farms Yeah, he used to do this, then discontinued egg shells altogether because he found issues with them, micro lacerations in the intestines, and preferred cheese with honey..

3530,Don't watch it I wont Why can't u drink raw milk after celery juice?.

Too much sugar/carbohydrates, even if raw, is toxic for our body.. It poses two important issues: glycemic imbalance which leads to energy crashes, and accumulation of toxins like AGEs, that cause 1/3 of diseases.. The body only has around 4g of sugar (glucose) circulating through the blood at a time.. Some of it is also stored as glycogen in muscles and in the liver.",5,115
3539,"It only converts other macros like fat or protein into sugar on-demand.. This is different from plants which store their energy as sugar.. Eating more a few carbohydrates drops the blood-fat level, and raises blood-sugar level, making the pancreas overwork through speedy secretion of insulin to get rid of those excess carbs in the blood.. This first creates a sugar spike that can lead to manic behavior and hyperactivity.. Then it is by followed by an energy crash, leaving us mentally and emotionally fatigued, irritable, sleepy, and/or depressed.",5,88
3540,"Monkeys that live on fruits are overly emotional.. Carb digestion also creates AGEs (Advanced Glycation End-Products, a glycotoxin).. Columbia University's Department of Medicine found that those store in a healthy body at a rate of 70%, and in an unhealthy body at a rate of 90%.. AGE is a corrosive substance, like an acid, that accumulates and eventually melts tissues, creating sagging skin, muscles.. It predisposes the body to cancer and many other diseases.",5,74

Salt is a rock, and our body cannot process rocks.. It has a toxic effect, different from the sodium found as a nutrient in plant or animal foods.",5,57
3563,"Water dissolves rocks, and plants eat rocks, then animals eat plants, and we eat the plants or animals.. This for us is food, the minerals are made into nutrients, becoming bio-available.. Rock salt is very different from the sodium found in food.. According to Aajonus, rock salt is an explosive.. Rock salt is a mineral formed from sodium chloride (NaCl).",5,60
3564,"When eating rock salt, during digestion, the sodium is separated from the chloride, so the sodium ion becomes isolated.. Isolated sodium is more volatile than nitroglycerin, this is when it becomes an explosive.. So during digestion and after, this isolated sodium creates micro-explosions in the blood, destroying other nutrients and killing cells.. Additionally, when the isolated sodium doesn't explode right away, it can draw other isolated sodium ions to itself, creating sodium clusters, and the magnetism of them can rip off the guts of cells.. This makes using rock salt the second worst thing next to cooking in standard diet practices.",5,101
3565,"One million red blood cells are destroyed by one little grain of salt.. When part of raw foods, even during digestion, sodium is always bound to other nutrients, they are always connected on a chemical level, it doesn't get isolated and therefore doesn't have this damaging effect..

Aajonus recommends eating raw animal protein (and accompanying raw fat) at least every 5h, that can be: raw eggs, raw meat, raw milk, or a combination (e.. g.",5,160
3629,"raw milkshake).. That is to prevent being in a state of autophagy.. When you eat foods, the digested nutrients end up in the blood, available for the body to use.. They do not circulate infinitely in the blood.. After as little as 5h, or even 4, 3, 2 hours, depending on the person, all those proteins in the blood are gone.",5,61
3630,"This is caused by our toxicity, and what Aajonus called mutant antibodies.. The toxins damage the protein nutrients in our blood stream.. The mutant antibodies are created in reaction to vaccines, and behave abnormally: they break down healthy protein, wasting it.. This is why healthy specimens that have lived in very good environments (such as non-polluted nature) are not affected by this, they can fast, they will not be protein-deficient after only a few hours.. What happens for us is that when our body runs out of protein because of toxicity, it has to cannibalize its own red blood cells to generate protein, which both weakens our body and makes it consume its own toxicity, since our bodies are at all times discarding stored toxicity, so eating our own tissues exposes us to more damage from our toxicity.",5,138
3631,"Aajonus recommends to wake up at night to eat raw animal protein within less than 5 hours since the last time raw animal protein was eaten, even if that involves using an alarm clock!. This may seem forced, but it gives much better quality sleep, as the body gets plenty of nutrients to heal, grow, remove its toxicity with less side-effects, etc.. It actually is the best way to solve morning fatigue, and the body gets used to it and wakes up on its own eventually..

Eating raw foods detoxifies the toxic by-products of cooked foods that were eaten in the past.. For example, in case of liver damage, eating raw liver can speed up healing.. For anyone that ate cooked dairy products in the past, eating raw dairy will help pull out the toxins from those that ended up stored in bodily tissues.",5,78
3750,"Each food has specific bacteria, and when an organism dies, its own bacteria consumes it, which helps recycle it.. Therefore it will allow the same to happen in the body: debris from cooked foods will be removed efficiently by a similar or identical raw food.. The bacteria will seek it out and has the proper design to process it.. The nutrients from raw foods give the body ammo to detoxify their processed, toxic counterparts.. Raw iron binds to toxic iron which allows the body to neutralize it and escort it out.",5,91
3751,"Raw calcium removes the cauterized calcium from pasteurized dairy, etc.. This works even with raw versions of foods that are not exactly the same, but more or less related.. For example, eating muscle meat will heal muscles faster even if the cut of meat being eaten isn't exactly the equivalent of the muscle that needs repair.. Drinking raw celery juice can detoxify past cooked greens (among other things), including cooked plants other than celery that were eaten.. This is a general rule, there can be other rules that are more important to heal a given body tissue:Sometimes the best remedies are not just ""to eat the same thing but raw"".",5,110

Carnivores don't need all those ""antidotes"" that we do Yeah that was my point, the glycogen stores for muscles are on demand basically, why aajonus differentiates and says carbs are OKAY for muscle glycogen Although his point was more likely that the slave mind is irrational whilst the body fuel is competent, not the point being that we should use carbs for muscle glycogen in the afternoon like i was saying is a possibility but doesn't he also say sometimes the brain/nervous system runs out of glycogen and then he pops another eggwouldn't that be on demand as well It also is not really apetizing Tough I feel like I cannot say much on that topic because I didnt experiment much with it but to me its just disgusting and doesnt seem like our ancestors would have acces to it You're 100% wrong.",5,299

Yeah, that's very legit at least I can feel it Do you happen to have the quote where he speaks of the muscle glycogen, trying to find it Otherwise if we eat carbs at 3pm we would have a sticky byproduct Good point, i think that comes down to adequate protein and fats in the blood and neurological system though Let‚Äôs see what he has to say..

Freezing foods, even if they are raw, destroys most of their nutritional value for most of them, and for some even generates toxins.",5,74
3781,"Exceptions include: fruits, fish that would survive thawing, raw ice cream for up to 24h.. In Aajonus' experiments, a group of dogs fed frozen raw butter developed diseases such as mange, while the group fed never-frozen raw butter remained healthy.. Then, the group that was eating frozen and was getting sick got placed on the never-frozen raw butter, and healed.. Aajonus concluded some foods could lose around 80% of their nutritional value from being frozen.. For certain foods, such as meat, freezing can also generate toxins from the proteins, in addition to destroying nutrients.",5,94
3782,"For these reasons, Aajonus preferred average quality fresh meat over frozen high quality meat.. Fruits are about the only foods that can be eaten frozen without issue.. Still, after they thaw, he recommends to eat them fast.. Fish that would survive freezing and thawing are another exception.. Since they would literally start moving again and resume their life after thawing, the kind of fish (such as Arctic Cod) that can endure this only loses a small amount of nutritional value, and can be eaten frozen without issue.",5,87
3783,"Finally, raw ice cream (recipes using raw cream, such as the ones Aajonus gives in his book The Recipe for Living Without Disease) can last up to 24h without losing substantial nutritional value.. It is recommended to flash freeze as that damages it the least.. If you consider using frozen meat to make high meat, thinking the nutritional value doesn't matter as much here, but only the presence of some bacteria, Aajonus also discourages this: the bacteria are changed from freezing, and they will induce more radical detoxifications.. https://www.. instagram.",5,90

I still do light excersice from time to time like Pull Ups and manage to maintain 80-85% of muscle I build when I started gym I was underweight and severly malnourished so that changed it a lot and im greatful I did gym now I can maintain my muscle mass atleast the amount my body wants and needs by eating a great diet.. Often times if you have stagnated energy you will want to move just use it up obviously being 100% sedentary is not the way to go im mostly talking about body building, running all of that I used to be in that culture and doing a ton od activity like running 30-60 mins everyday and working out 1h+ 6-7 days a week and just pushing my body even tho I didnt want to.",5,241

I believe we should all listen to our body and the signs it gives I believe if your goal is to build muscme for a few years and then just maintain it its a great idea look at Aajonus for example Imagine looking like this at 60+ while not working out for over 40+ years 20* He did not work out for over 20 years my badüòÇ He ate the primal diet for 40+ Intense anaerobic workouts every day are no good..

If microplastics were found even on an uninhabited island Then every river and water body in general is polluted to some extent Well toxins are spread everywhere because of air its all in the air too The worst are nanoplastics honestly Thats flaw of every low carb diet eventually Aajonus says the best source of glycogen is proteins, that get converted into pyruvate Carbs can gives you better explosive perfomance but its a shitty fuel since you can store no more that 300-400g which IS 1600 kcal , with fat you have unlimited energy while you have body fat How do we know the problem of those low carb diet is the low carb aspect and not other hidden aspects like them being cooked or them being no plants because of trying to avoid carbs in general Yeah, I am aware that if needed, protein can convert into carbs, however if that would happen that regularly that it always feels up all the glycogen stores, there is no place for ketosis in the organism Since body works with a large amount of carbohydrates pretty often.",5,319
3786,"Yes, but again that does not answer my question about empty glycogen stores when you on ketosis Which is fuel for muscle nonetheless According to Aajonus this happens in the first few hours of the day, the body making glycogen for the whole day.. And with protein it does it cleanly, while with sugar it generates a lot of toxins and obstructs the body's function Interesting.. I think even some proteins would not be suitable (from toxic sources) What are your experience working out while on ketosis?. I once worked out fasted and almost passed out and had shitty light headed feeling for the rest of the day.. I never measured ketosis levels, even when I was eating ""carnivore"" and working out, or fasting, so I don't know.",5,128

I don't fully understand what do you exactly mean Do I buy the jar The problem IS if you dont leave ketosis state for example people with keto diets  lowers test after months without leaving ketosis How does that work Well, we cannot really do anything about it on a global scale.. Besides avoiding plastics (which is impossible if you travel often enough) as much as you can and living healthy lifestyle.. put butter in milkshake today was good Fun fact: Inuits also eat a fair amount of carbs due to the temperature there preventing rigor mortis, therefore the glycogen remains intact.. Fun fact #2: marine mammals have higher glycogen stores to assist deep diving.",5,154

Take 45-minutes-long hot baths, use hot water bottles at night, or do physical activity.. (But avoid saunas.. )According to Aajonus, 90% of detoxification occurs through the skin.. This means that the body sends 90% of the toxins to be eliminated through the skin.",5,118
3832,"However, they are only deposited under the skin.. It is still required to sweat for them to come out.. Leaving those toxins under the skin can create substantial discomfort and damage over time.. Besides from his main diet advice, this is one of the most important quotes from Aajonus:I recommend everybody ‚Äì unless they‚Äôre an athlete who sweats ever day - get into a hot bath for 40 minutes.. It‚Äôs important because that will stay under your skin and if it builds up year after year, it causes deterioration of connective tissue, destruction of skin, and can lead to lupus, MS, destruction of your nerves - all of your tissues internally.",5,111
3833,"You‚Äôve got to perspire those poisons out of your body.. Therefore, whether through sports, hot baths, or using hot water bottles (that you can sleep with at night for example), it is necessary to sweat often.. Not only is it necessary to avoid potentially severe damage being caused long-term, but it immediately can remove feelings of lethargy, irritability, unease, makes one feel lighter, clear-headed, can help with appetite issues, sleep, healing, and body function overall.. Notes:Saunas must however be avoided because their temperature are too hot and damage the skin and mucous membranes.. (Besides, air doesn't offer as good heat transfer as water does, so hot baths are superior although they are at lower temperatures).",5,115
3834,"The temperature the body is exposed to should not be above 43.. 3¬∞C (110¬∞F) maximum or it will cause damage.. When taking hot bath, if the water is not natural water (from hot springs or heated by your own system), but municipal, treated, water, add ingredients to neutralize the toxins in the water: 2-3 cups of raw milk, 3 tablespoons of raw vinegar, 2 tablespoons of salt (for example Epsom or sea salt)..

3976,"You will benefit from an eating window of up to 30 minutes without toxins dumping into the gut.. Raw unsalted cheese very efficiently absorbs the many toxins that the body deposits in the gut, which enables painless detoxification, and to improve digestion significantly.. Aajonus discovered that raw unsalted cheese doesn't digest, but instead absorbs toxins very efficiently.. For almost everyone, many toxins store in the gut.. Since the stomach is very resilient and contains digestive acids, the body deposits toxins there, where the acids can neutralize them.",5,87
3977,"This also gives a chance for the toxins to get eliminated from the body by being carried away with the food going through.. However, most foods end up getting damaged and contaminated by the toxins that the body dumps in the gut, and many of those toxins end up being ""recycled"", stored back into the body.. When eating raw unsalted cheese, the cheese, if truly raw and with no added salt, draws the toxins to itself and neutralizes them with its concentrated minerals and fats.. Therefore, eat a piece of cheese (around half a teaspoon to a teaspoon) 10 minutes before you eat any other foods (whether solid or liquid, even water).. When you first eat a piece of cheese, it will go and collect the toxins, clearing the way for the food that you want to eat next.",5,139
3978,"This improves digestion significantly (making it around twice better), and appetite.. Wait at least 10 minutes after eating that piece of cheese, no more toxins will be dumped in the body for up to 30 minutes, so you can eat without your food encountering toxins, and get improved digestion.. If you eat before the 10 minutes have passed since eating the piece of cheese, the body will deposit more toxins in the gut, but it will still be less than if you didn't eat any cheese at all before.. The total duration of this ""toxin-dumping"" cycle that is reset by the cheese is of 40 minutes (similar to the duration of REM sleep cycles).. https://www.",5,115

Hi @leclayrom for the chrons/leaky gut protocol should I just stick to the schedule of eggs and celery juice w/honey or also include tiny amounts of cheese and milkshake as the pyramid suggest?. yes if you are certain you have crohn's, then it's safer to do just eggs for a while, and then, to include some very small amounts of butter/honey, and then sips of milkshakes, progressively, when it has already healed enough (which is vague to know but overall that's how it goes) Okay thanks.",5,143

I don't see the logic in living a long life via primal diet if the life you live is gonna be very uneventful and restrictive.. But I guess this would be a set of choices and acknowledgments that everyone on the diet would have to be aware of.. Compromising and balancing would be necessary I agree to an extent..

4337,"@leclayrom he mentions the red blood cells ""shrivels up"" like Aajonus too because it's bound to other nutrients in a way that it doesnt' completely separate from them during digestion I agree, just like he said in the cancer control society.. Noone understands what half of those biochemists were yappin about and for that reason its mostly irrelevant No, she wasn't doing Raw Primal, although she knew of Aajonus.. I think she stopped because of her medical doctor husband and they were both doing cooked carnivore, last I checked Both You talking bout the one who passed away?. Exactly, like you use the mercury in raw fish but not if it is in anyway processed, like on cooking Yeah except some carnivore influencers Don't know but don't think so..

Same thing happens to me I tried some crackers a month ago got a headache a few hours later Must instant salt detox Sorry for being rude i see what you mean Definitely get an adrenaline rush Drink sea water and tell me you ain‚Äôt dehydrated no its just diarrhea good detox fr Aajonus talks about the ions resulting from the body processing the salt, making the cells unable to eat and that they would shrivel like a raisin Very specific concentrations of salt, when you add salt to water like normies do this is what happens to their blood and imo why it causes an adrenaline reaction because you get anemia temporarily from crenation..

I used to ask myself these questions but I never decided to google it I could be wrong on the exact figure, but it's on the ""Early Training with Aajonus"" book It could be but aajonus has made claims that scientists have never scraped the surface of so it could still be true What u think @leclayrom cause imo aajonus kinda ruins his opinion on salt with the explosion statement.. For science normies anyway There was a woman who was doing raw carnivore in the Phillipines and the freshly cut meat in the markets was convulsing non-stop.. I haven't seen nowhere else, but I haven't looked for it She had a YouTube Channel, Asra Conlu or something She changed to cooked carnivore last time I looked it up Sodium is very volatile, you need it bound with a smorgasbord of nutrients so it doesn‚Äôt have to seperate on its own and then find a cell.",5,232
4341,Sodium in salt is also a very large amount.. Sodium from salt is the largest ‚Äúelectrolyte‚Äù particle whilst natural sodium is the smallest molecule.. So you can see why the natural systems could mess up the utilisation of sodium chloride/salt.. Any salt is atleast 35-40% sodium.. Way more concentrated then any natural sodium you would find bioavailable in whole foods.,5,60

In Aajonus' experiments, a group of dogs fed frozen raw butter developed diseases such as mange, while the group fed never-frozen raw butter remained healthy.. Then, the group that was eating frozen and was getting sick got placed on the never-frozen raw butter, and healed.. Aajonus concluded some foods could lose around 80% of their nutritional value from being frozen.",5,98
4571,"For certain foods, such as meat, freezing can also generate toxins from the proteins, in addition to destroying nutrients.. For these reasons, Aajonus preferred average quality fresh meat over frozen high quality meat.. Fruits are about the only foods that can be eaten frozen without issue.. Still, after they thaw, he recommends to eat them fast.. Fish that would survive freezing and thawing are another exception.",5,66
4572,"Since they would literally start moving again and resume their life after thawing, the kind of fish (such as Arctic Cod) that can endure this only loses a small amount of nutritional value, and can be eaten frozen without issue.. Finally, raw ice cream (recipes using raw cream, such as the ones Aajonus gives in his book The Recipe for Living Without Disease) can last up to 24h without losing substantial nutritional value.. It is recommended to flash freeze as that damages it the least..

I dont see why it would cancel out the pineapple and cucumber tho Cucumber puree in vegetable juice I have blended it with butter and honey and it's still a rough one Thank you Eating liver is really brutal for me man It has been used for wounds to prevent people bleeding out like Aker explained A: Well, the first time I saw spontaneous anything, this Indian doctor, scientist, had isolated a little, what do they call that, like an aquarium environment, only it had its natural flow of water only, and there were no bacteria, there were no parasites.",5,291

Bur aajonus says different that it will still consume healthy cells of not eating protein Ye He and sv3rige share a lot of similarities don‚Äôt compare aajonus to sverige And that fasting can stop detoxification because we need nutrients for optimal and clean detox Also fasting produces negative hormones and stress on the body Why are y'all so obsessed with him It kind of makes me like him Not that hes really against it but he would promote to not drink dairy Ty.. I literally can‚Äôt walk rn lol Even if you dont agree with the system you cant change it sitting on your ass The monetary system is meant to enslave us It invokes spirits Shower won‚Äôt engulf your body to heat it up.. And unless you have well water it is toxic It's a way to channel demons Doesn't have to if you have prayer alongside it i want to sweat toxins and seed oils out in shower how do i achieve this then it's not yoga but stretching or some bs.. Yoga is tied to hindu spirituality You can use hot water bottles and cover yourself in blankets Then it sounds like the opposite of satanic Hindo spirituality is satanic.",5,239
4861,Hidu Gods are Demons bruv You should not even do Yoga without a Yogi since you can invoke spirits without knowing That's worrisome then How is yoga satanic You need a Yogi spirit guide when doing yoga otherwise you open yourself up to possession they are small bro on what You can by joining a yoga school with good reputaion that has a yogi/yoga teacher that ideally learned from a real yogi in India.. Still I would not recommend it and  would look for other physical exercise or spiritual practice Impossible.. YOG-a has goy in it lol Lay 3 towels down put 1 between calves 1 between thighs 2 outside hips 2 under arm pits one towel on top.. Then you need a down comforter which I don't have so I just used my blanket.. All water bottles wrapped in a pillow sheet I haven't done them @bludiamhim.,5,148
4862,"You can try it that way just make sure to cover yourself in mad  blankets when you do it so you sweat proper Do you believe that about meditation too, someone once told me it creates the vulnerability for spirits to come in Yes I do, but it depends heavily on the type of meditation and the intent of the meditation.. I could write a book about this.. I have been attacked  by ""bad energies"" when meditating as a teen and after was afraid to meditate again.. I only recently started doing a ""silent prayer"" which I guess is meditation.. Can I give coconut oil to the vegetable juice?",5,109
4863,"Wow maybe you will write a book.. Id understand being afraid to meditate after.. Do you feel more protected during silent prayer, and are you just saying a prayer in your mind, heart, body rather than just sitting in silence trying to silence thoughts?. too strong detox How do I get one, they just need to be a spirit guide doesn't have to be an actual physical teacher?. Hot water bottles Yoga is satanic what can i do if i have no bath will hot showers do in other group we have yes.",5,93

4866,"How can you do edging offline man?. It's not possible you need internet bro Can you tell me what you believe?. A handful Interesting that there‚Äôs a handful of people in one area Some come and go Is this the Scott hall amish group Scott hall funky dancing group now some overlap but still very different he speaks of hot baths, exercise, it's not just diet either No Did AV do yoga?. yeah What kind?. I heard him talk of one pose specifically I forget the name for how long I just sit in silence while I'm trying to be observant of my thoughts and the feelings they create.",5,109
4867,I'm watching myself and my body while being aware.. I feel safe when doing the silent prayer.. The entire approach and perspective are different for me.. It's not meditation with the goal of enlightenment or any other personal gain.. It's staying in silence to get into the presence of God.,5,50
4868,"In that, it's easy for me to see the spirits or emotions that arise for what they are without being afraid of them and knowing that they have no power.. Perfect For the past month I have been drinking vegetable juice with a whole lime, a whole lemon and a piece of ginger like two fingers.. The ginger is steaming and the citrus is sour.. Can I drink that much lemon lime and ginger?. 2x per day Man sun on ballz is nice Just flash them quick Like legit 15-30 seconds to start I remember when i started my nuts burned in a minute or too üòÇ Damn hot sauce and raw steak is killer That area is probably never been in the sun so we have to start really short peroid Just need lots of milk Go out in nature or open a window How do you feel?",5,149
4869,"If you have sun after night shift, is it fix that you dont sleep all night?. I think it helps somewhat but nothing major Then you could sleep just in the sun Like 8h sleeping in the sun I actually need peace and quiet to sleep and it's noisy outside my house.. Also I can only really sleep in pitch black So you're not telling me to go on the night shift?. I have a choice, but working in the restaurant kitchen at night is much cooler - there is no one, calmly, you can turn on the music.. And also, no one pushes me to work - I can do sips, cheese passes as much as I want and whenever I want That atmosphere at night is so amazingThat is why I am thinking about it seriously That's the exact reason why I like night shift.",5,147
4870,"Much more calmer and the job overall is easier.. Alot of people who went from nights to days have had mixed feelings about the switch Some say they still can't sleep much and others say that it's a big improvement on their mental health I'm also not convinced that humans are strict dinural I can't imagine a tribe of humans sleeping 8 hours straight in the wilderness And one more thing.. I'm temporarily working in the kitchen and breathing all this terrible air-burning oils, and all the other food.. It's harmful.. If I work at night, I won't breathe it.",5,100
4871,"I will breathe only fresh air + I can afford cheese passes and sips Considering that this is temporary, about a month.. Maybe night shifts are worth it?. Hundreds of times less toxicity Fucking.. I wish I could sleep 4 hours a day like Aajonus So you gonna wake up at 2 am for what It's terrible.. I know from experience I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth For real I did not do hot baths.",5,73
4872,I did juice.. I experimented with doing all of it.. I do not like unsalted cheese it tastes medicinal.. I don‚Äôt think the diet is bad at all.. Damn ye that's my issue too But I would If I could Should I juice watermelon rinds or eat them whole?,5,49
4873,"Shit man I know it's not good Raw beef should hell I guess so Yes Would mushrooms help Is the night shift bad?. If I'm on a strict primary, will night work every day be bad?. And yet, how can you reduce sleep time without losing recovery?. It's very bad bro Sunlight is vital Your circadian rythm will become very distorted Night shift become zombies Yeah but most people who work typical shifts are the ones missing sunlight since they're at work all day Trust me In the office Good point Our society is so toxic How do people in Alaska cope without having sunlight That's why i am glad to work outside For half the year I work night shift and I know it's bad; I plan to go day shift in the future but when I get home from work I lay in the sun for about 1-2 hours That's really good bro Atleast you get that sun, very healing I would recommend sunning your taint and balls too.. Unironically it increases your bodies testosterone production naturally Lmfao I don't have that type of privacy at my house This dude said taint and balls At least working you have a chance to impact the lives of others That's probably because they are paranoid about so many farm animals being vaccinated and injected with hormones Sv3rige and its consequences have been a disaster for the Primal Race So this is more of a cult I‚Äôve never heard anyone say it‚Äôs white to drink raw milk Yeah as far as I know some of those African tribes lived mainly or raw milk on* Large % of their diets You‚Äôre here?",5,280

If aaj was so pure in what he was doing then why do their lives share many common themes.",5,99
4878,Why is there such an overlap in the following?. Rom is probably the only person on the diet or in the community that actually cares about others health and has any morality.. Isn‚Äôt that just the gnostic believe that the God in the Bible is actually Satan and that the snake actually enlightened Adam?. Sv3rige promotes eating foods in specific ways to maximize their benefits?. It‚Äôs just raw food for thought Allegedly.,5,72

They pull out free radical heavy metals Not the beneficial ones nigger is chad For example the body cannot utilise vitamin B1 from a supplement the same way There‚Äôs some overlap with Ayurvedic modalities and remedies as well, and he pulled a lot from traditional tribes..

Would you mind sending It was or it wasn't the most important thing?. I haven‚Äôt seen the quote in a couple years i can try find it Again none of this is an attack on anyone doing this diet..

Maybe a hot compress What is the problem with the ""agenda""?. Aajonus recognizes his flaws in the book and the wrong he did What's that Hot water bottle Because eating raw meat is considered edgywhen it's actually normalJust like some people make raw milk into something of racial superiority, this was literally never on Aajonus' mind when he spoke of African tribes drinking 90% raw milk lol Aajonus never really made a family though, so he probably still had issues Thanks I'll take the compliment Are you the standard for what morality looks like ?.

Drinking raw celery juice can detoxify past cooked greens (among other things), including cooked plants other than celery that were eaten..

So during digestion and after, this isolated sodium creates micro-explosions in the blood, destroying other nutrients and killing cells.. Additionally, when the isolated sodium doesn't explode right away, it can draw other isolated sodium ions to itself, creating sodium clusters, and the magnetism of them can rip off the guts of cells.. This makes using rock salt the second worst thing next to cooking in standard diet practices.. One million red blood cells are destroyed by one little grain of salt.",5,95

Wait just symptoms of toxins building up everywhere in the body basically I don't know what the toxins are, and Aajonus didn't specify.. You can tell by the effects which are:- loss of appetite for meat / fat and even aversion for it- overacidic feeling in the gut / heartburn- increasing lethargy- brainfog- more irritated, anxious- feeling of sluggishness- start to cough more often- with time, worse hair quality, worse teeth quality What toxins does celery juice specifically remove?. And what are the negative side effects I should expect if I carry on dismissing it?",5,147
5335,"From experience celery juice is impossible to avoid when eating exclusively raw animal foods, period.. It's extremely important because there are toxins that only it can remove, otherwise your body just gets damaged constantly and keeps getting worse after a while Aajonus said this, some of the plant toxins going away after 24h.. This is just a side fact anywayCelery is low in oxalates, plants high in oxalates, like spinach, Aajonus wouldn't recommend, because even he said that could give kidney problems.. He was very well aware of plant toxins but he has empirical data, he knows which one is good in which quantity in practice.. Additionally when you juice celery (not blending it by the way), the minerals from within the juice bind to the remaining plant toxins, so they're already neutralized.",5,133
5336,"Someone mentioned here that the plant toxins are gone after 24 hours of it being unrooted, do you think this as well?. Not one plant has less than 60 known carcinogens, do you think this is all destroyed when blended?. usually, yes Should I increase vegetable juicce quantity if I don‚Äôt feel the efffects of it , increasing appetitte And if it makes you feel acidic in your gut / heartburn or have diarrhea / headaches at first, it's normal, it can happenJust keep doing and it will go away and you will only feel good from it often on its own sometimes with either of those (+honey) Interesting, do you have it on its own or do you also mix it with cream and eggs such as Adrian?. And these toxins all start dumping and building up because of the acidity in the body from starting to eat raw meat, which is then counteracted by the celery juice which is alkalinising?. not sure but to some extent yeah they dump in great part from eating raw, that lets the body detoxify more, but you need certain foods like raw animal fat and celery juice to help handle those toxins and eliminate them completely out of the body yes, also you probably need a bit more fat in the form of raw butter He didn't explain how it works chemically like he does sometimes, he just stated the effect.",5,239

And in some remedies he says to use green juice, which can even be spinach juice (in small amounts)So maybe it's something about those green foodsThe only known replacements given by Aajonus are also green: sugar cane and unripe papaya (which is mostly green) However it probably isn't the sodium content alone that does it, eating endless amounts of tomatoes doesn't do the same as celery juice Celery cleans the blood and there is a relationship with the blood here and all of this is just trying to figure out why but as I mentioned he didn't explain it in detail and there are only hints at most This speculation That's not speculation, Aajonus mentioned how plant foods are more detoxifying and animal foods are more balanced The minerals in animal foods can build the body, they can't from plants Pickets in support of Pavel Durov are being held around the world at French embassiesProtests in support of the Telegram founder have already taken place in Russia, Armenia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland and Vietnam..

You will benefit from an eating window of up to 30 minutes without toxins dumping into the gut.",5,136
5402,"Raw unsalted cheese very efficiently absorbs the many toxins that the body deposits in the gut, which enables painless detoxification, and to improve digestion significantly.. Aajonus discovered that raw unsalted cheese doesn't digest, but instead absorbs toxins very efficiently.. For almost everyone, many toxins store in the gut.. Since the stomach is very resilient and contains digestive acids, the body deposits toxins there, where the acids can neutralize them.. This also gives a chance for the toxins to get eliminated from the body by being carried away with the food going through.",5,92
5403,"However, most foods end up getting damaged and contaminated by the toxins that the body dumps in the gut, and many of those toxins end up being ""recycled"", stored back into the body.. When eating raw unsalted cheese, the cheese, if truly raw and with no added salt, draws the toxins to itself and neutralizes them with its concentrated minerals and fats.. Therefore, eat a piece of cheese (around half a teaspoon to a teaspoon) 10 minutes before you eat any other foods (whether solid or liquid, even water).. When you first eat a piece of cheese, it will go and collect the toxins, clearing the way for the food that you want to eat next.. This improves digestion significantly (making it around twice better), and appetite.",5,127
5404,"Wait at least 10 minutes after eating that piece of cheese, no more toxins will be dumped in the body for up to 30 minutes, so you can eat without your food encountering toxins, and get improved digestion.. If you eat before the 10 minutes have passed since eating the piece of cheese, the body will deposit more toxins in the gut, but it will still be less than if you didn't eat any cheese at all before.. The total duration of this ""toxin-dumping"" cycle that is reset by the cheese is of 40 minutes (similar to the duration of REM sleep cycles).. https://www.. instagram.",5,105

So during digestion and after, this isolated sodium creates micro-explosions in the blood, destroying other nutrients and killing cells.. Additionally, when the isolated sodium doesn't explode right away, it can draw other isolated sodium ions to itself, creating sodium clusters, and the magnetism of them can rip off the guts of cells..

What happens for us is that when our body runs out of protein because of toxicity, it has to cannibalize its own red blood cells to generate protein, which both weakens our body and makes it consume its own toxicity, since our bodies are at all times discarding stored toxicity, so eating our own tissues exposes us to more damage from our toxicity.. Aajonus recommends to wake up at night to eat raw animal protein within less than 5 hours since the last time raw animal protein was eaten, even if that involves using an alarm clock!.

Yes.. I still slip up sometimes and put too much and if I do I have a mess to clear up.. Okay thanks I‚Äôll try with even less next time.. It‚Äôs so annoying almost impossible to clean properly Yeah.",5,80
5818,I find you have to tip it upside down to get the slimy egg out it‚Äôs no joke.. I want to put it under running water but I‚Äôm not sure it could take it No I wouldn‚Äôt do that.. That‚Äôs why I tip upside down and let the slime run out.. Then get material in it after to pick up the rest of it.. Uh oh Thanks What do I do to get rid of intracellular toxins?,5,77
5819,"Just cheese and raw fats and diet?. nothing very different, it's just more difficult for the body to remove from inside the cells The body is negatively charged.. Toxins in the body at positively charged.. Aged urine will draw out those toxins The ionic charge thing seems legit although I don't recall Aajonus talking about it, it is one explanation for how the body identifies toxins and how they are drawn out Later on he said it's not so important anymoreHe said rebounder is mostly useful if you stayed like 10h in a hot bath, otherwise the lymph might not be fluid enough Aajonus didn't speak of aged urine but yeah it should be fine (as long as it's not the first urine in the morning, which is toxic whether fresh or aged)As for the alkaline thing, Aajonus claimed that something being more alkaline does not necessarily make it more beneficial.. He recommends plenty of acidic foods for their benefits.",5,160
5820,"However a high presence of minerals will lead to more alkalinity and more minerals is good in general Aged urine is hardly toxic.. Urine is a distilled water that is highly negatively charged.. Aged urine is also alkaline and thus has the same benefits of alkaline water.. There are trace amounts of stem cells in fresh urine, when urine is aged then the amount of stem cells multiply and grow.. Aged urine is an alkaline distilled stem cell filled water.",5,80
5821,It can be absorbed internally through the digestive tract or externally through the skin I think aajonus recommended walking for 45min after bath What is best using rebounder or taking a walk Np Blue and amber.. üëÄ Wtf is this Aajonus always said blue and hazel are only true eye colors..

5823,"be/jyfa454Akm0?. si=W8kVm19a-6vXYwq6 Yeah that seems to be a thingSo if you were fat but still have blue eyes, you probably don't have as many intracellular toxins because they went to the fatOtherwise skinny your whole life + blue they might have gone intracellular For detox metal https://youtu.. be/RA7G1dgJXEQ?. si=IPdiRQzhKgZ6TVaB Do you even know why Aajonus said it's toxic in the morningYour blood is toxic in the morning because there is a strong detox happening at nightSo morning urine is the most toxic and to avoid at all costs according to him, unless you want the dumped heavy metals and other toxins from the night What about me?. I‚Äôm African can I get blue eyes?",5,114
5824,"I am and now it's much easier to put the head in the water than in the beginning As long as you can handle it it should be fineIf it feels hard during the bath then it might be better to cool the head downWhenever possible it's good to get the head underwater even partiallyYou probably won't get such a strong detox anymore from it, it should lessen over time, permanent gain Just good detox No Are you vaccinated?. If not imagine how someone vaccinated would feel like after bath if he didn't cool his head Do you have interesting books?. The kind that I can't find in the store, For example, Effects of EMF on the body I don't cool my head, I have my head in the water up to my mouth so that my face also has better blood circulation and to my ears.. Now when I got out of the bath, I had dizziness, I could see and hear 50%.. Later I vomited and had tinnitus.",5,170
5825,"It just passed but, I thought I was going to die :P Let me look Where can I find this?. Thanks I disagree.. Urine is a byproduct of the blood.. It is only toxic if your blood is toxic.. For men fresh morning urine contains a lot of testosterone.",5,49
5826,"Urine is always medicinal and beneficial to drink (unless your kidneys are failing lol)The idea that urine is toxic is brainwashing.. Just like the idea that bacteria and parasites are bad for us Thats great Aajonus claims he and some of his clients did, we have yet to see that drastic a transformation more recently though Maybe it can't fully, the reason being the blood is not supposed to transport as many nutrients as it does in the first place so it is probably not equipped to save them when making urine Is there anyone that has actually gotten blue eyes from the diet?. It could be the nutrient part yes, but I tend to think the body won't get rid of nutrients that are still usable, especially during a fast when there is scarcity of resources.. The body is probably smart enough to only discard unusable things through urine.. I agree that drinking urine will probably prevent some detox since it limits one pathway It could also be from him simply getting nutrients by recycling them whereas in a water fast he is just depleting himself I think the body will detox less overall if you drink urine, this retoxify so this stops symptoms.",5,205
5827,"Aajonus mentionned in an interview that he did once a 40 days fast while drinking urine and felt better than during shorter fasts where he did not drink urine.. I think the explanation is because the urine prevented him from detoxing.. but you know you can do lab tests on all these things, so you can find out rather easily In addition to that you have Aajonus mentioning that if you drink your urine, the body will detox less through itThat still doesn't prevent the morning urine from being the most toxic by far Urine is one of the main detox pathway.. If anything, someone who follows the primal diet will detoxify more and have a more toxic urine than someone following a cooked diet.. There is a whole ebook written by a plumber who worked with Aajonus ^^but if your body is toxic you may not be displaying your ""true"" eye color.",5,153
5828,"It is probably lighter if you werent toxic Thanks for sending, I actually meant about turning your jaccuzi into a lymph bath I thought eye color is genetic?. well i don't know something that will work overnight but you can eat a lot of lub formula which will feed the skin from the inside and also raw  chicken is the best meat for skin so if you add those things maybe they will speed up the process also I'm not the best one to ask, try asking rom he is the best one to ask when it comes to PD What?.
