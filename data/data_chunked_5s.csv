True I specifically said you can absolutely do it if you do it half assed and promote other bad shit in the meantime So virality is obviously achievable Whose channels consist mostly of eating cooked meat 😂 We were discussing blowing up I mean you showed guys getting millions of views The popularity factor It’s not that complicated to understand Anybody can talk about anything if you get 5 views Maybe raw dairy is I can go on youtube right now and find Aajonus?.

There’s people with millions of followers doing that And kinda make a circus out of it If you just eat raw meat and don’t emphasise PD Like I said This guy eats brain and stuff raw, he isn’t primal but an example of pulling decent views @EliXAnpa So cool 😁 Psyop or not he's got millions of guys looking up to him I know you hate Tate but how can you say he has no desired qualities?.

44,For natural hot springs you need geothermal activity.. Best Poland can do is banya in the woods.. I guess this depends on the quality of the RO filter.. Scientists use the highest quality of RO devices that make perfect pure water when they need some for their experiments.. But commercially available are cheaper and aren't as efficient at removing stuff in the water.,5,63
45,"Anyway I don't think even a perfect RO device is a good idea since it also remove all the minerals in the water in addition to the toxins.. I agree with this, that’s why I said I like RawMeatExperiment’s approach and how he’s just telling people to do what they want but sort of leading by example and showing them they can eat raw meat and become healthierAnd it’s something anybody can do with minimal equipment and no production qualityIf he’s not making that much money yet I’m sure you at least meet a lot of like minded people along the way and help some people Thank you Anyone here from Java (#Indonesia)?. Yes but the question is there anyone who is skilled enough to actually assess a person's changing chemsitry and give good nutrition recomendations?. As we all know, even something as simple as saying to ""drink lots of water"" can be very harmful and damage nutrition and the body.. I guess what I'm saying is that I think it would be hard to give advice for lots of people on a platform when people watching you may be fragile and need specific remedies.",5,195
46,"And that it would take a person a long time to become good at assessing what may be needed for specific people GastritisA: Gastritis happens a lot of times when you have gas.. You have toxins that dump into the intestinal wall and there’s not enough mucus to harness them - in the mucus lining.. It’s almost always in people who are too thin, especially when you have Crohn’s disease or any kind of inflammatory bowel system.. They don’t create mucus properly, enough to protect the lining.. So the poisons don’t get locked into the mucus, they get into the digestive tract where the food is.",5,106
47,"Then your digestive juices mix with those poisons and it creates gas.. Gas can cause severe pain, diarrhea, headaches.. You have to eat cheese until you're relieved.. You have to eat a lot of milkshakes to get your mucus producing properly.. A lot of people have very thin mucus.",5,49
48,"Under a microscope, it looks like a piece of fabric; it’s layers and layers of woven fibres.. If you can see through it, it’s not tight.. Toxins and even your own digestive acids can get through and eat at your intestinal tract.. That’s the worst case of Crohn’s.. When you eat the proper proteins, everything is so tight nothing can get through.",5,62
49,"You’ve sometimes got 80 layers of these mucus fibres protecting your intestines, especially if you’re a sick person - you should have a lot.. He probably has a good size.. He has a lot of weight there to protect so he can afford to manufacture a lot of mucus.. That’s another reason I like people to be that size so they get well.. I was that size for 20 years, to get well.",5,73
50,"Even up to a year and a half ago I got that big.. I had a 38” waist and I’m only 5’ 7 ¾”.. I was 190 lbs, 20 lbs more than I am now.. So, lots of milkshakes to create the mucus, cheese to absorb the toxins so they don’t create as much gas.. Processed sugars eat right into the mucus lining.",5,63
51,"In the intestines, the villi determine whether there is enough hydrochloric acid or other enzymes to break down the larger food particles so the bacteria can eat them - 80-90% of digestion is bacterial.. Only 10-20% is enzymatic - digestive juices.. So it’s mainly bacteria which perform your digestion.. When you’re taking antibiotics you have to rely on only the enzymes in digestive juices and you only get a tiny bit of your nutrients.. People get very, very weak after taking antibiotics.",5,82
52,Your body is 99% bacteria.. You take 5 days of antibiotics you reduce it by 1%.. That’s reducing 1% of the functions of your whole body.. Take them for 2 weeks and it’s 3%.. They put my mother on antibiotics for a year and I didn’t know about it.,5,49
53,"I got a call.. They said ‘your mom’s going to die, come, she’ll be dead in 5 days’.. She stopped eating because she couldn’t digest.. When I found out about it I knew right away what to do.. I fed her custards, with papaya to help the enzymes start working again, and the butter, the honey and the eggs - everything very easily digestible.",5,64
54,"I gave her ½ cup of that early morning, 6am.. At 10 o’clock I gave her the other ½ cup and she ate 3 meals that day.. Cooked of course, but she ate 3 meals.. ?. She wouldn’t eat the papaya the next day, because the butter was too much for her, because of the damage from the antibiotics so I gave her ½ cup of papaya every day.",5,69
55,She ate 3 meals a day.. She recovered.. She’s still alive at 91 and she was meant to die from that years ago.. So you see what antibiotics can do.. The major part of the body is bacteria.,5,38
56,"If you buy into the pharmaceutical and medical industries, that bacteria is the cause of disease - you have just counted yourself as a disease because you are 99% bacteria.. We need to make a proper water filter, IIRC Aajonus claims that even R.. O only filters out a small percent of fluoride and other contaminants..

57,"I've just searched for the word ""autopsies"" There should be because we recently updated together with files from both, but I will check Ok thanks 👍 I've researched on heathfully and couldn't find it..

58,"Do we know how Aajonus was able to do autopsies?. same it's lovely Milk I leave outside is I really like kéfir taste Bathing in that atm And the quote doesn't appear Its not like we would be promoting anything outside of the diet, and legally we are only diagnosing toxicity not prescribing medicine or diagnosing illnesses However, if we got a lot more people producing primal food products like dairy, cheese, honey - that would be great Here's the problem from my perspective.. Successful buisiness in a lot of ways hinges on stability of processes, but in dealing with the primal diet it is the opposite of stability.. Health and illness can be quite complex, making it very difficult to scale up a buisiness like you would with a stable, industrial process or product.. If anyone were to lead a venture like that, they would have to have a lot of knowledge and accurate intuition when dealing with people and food - like AV was.",5,166
59,"AV says that it takes the average person 10 years of observation to understand how their body works with raw food.. That is 10 years to get a mild understanding of their individual body.. So think about the time, study, and observation it takes to understand the complexities of countless body types and diseases that exist.. It would take at least two decades of study and observation to become basic master of PD in my opinion.. Before someone has studied that long and had true experience with diesease, I don't think they have the buisiness of trying to be a face of the Primal Diet as hey are more likely to hurt people than to make them better in my opinion.",5,121

183,it’s sealed all the same and there’s no difference in the amount of bubbles Do the hot baths if you have persistent body odor I think you might be confusing different things.. I’m comparing mason jar with the plastic container that comes with the blender.. both are closed You're supposed to fill the mason so there is no air left in the jar even when I do that there’s still bubbles Obviously there is less oxygen in a closed and full air tight jar than a large jug with air you can fill each up to the brim to mitigate that.. my point is I don’t think his mason jar approach is air tight in the first place There probably isn’t a material difference if you use a mason jar or the plastic jar they give.. vacuum sealing is the only thing that will make a clear difference The bubbles are just a small residential amount.,5,156
184,"The jar isn't sucking in air as it blends i’m using a 1993 vintage oster Yes, if you fill a plastic jug with a lid it will obviously have the same effect You're not supposed to use plastic and the point of the jars is that you can use different sizes you can press down on the lid which would reduce the amount of air that squeaks in from the bottom.. All i’m saying is in my experience it isn’t evident that his approach substantially reduces the bubbles which is the only way we can eyeball oxidation There are juices that change colour when oxidised.. Like sugarcane juice.. You could try blending it with different methods interesting might give that a go some day and compare.. I somehow lost my base for my oster and the second hand replacements aren’t fitting my mason jar I didn't realise you were talking about oxygen entering via the bottom side.",5,157
185,But this is unlikely the case as some liquid would have to escape to displace the volume yea I just meant both aspects of it obvsly can’t push down on the mason jar much.. on one hand the mason jar is sealed from the top which is a plus but on the other hand the bottom side might be a more snug fit with the jar it was specifically designed for.. Don’t really know either way i think vacuum seal would be best i imagine it didn’t exist when aaj was around I highly doubt a full sealed jar is breathing much as it blends fair enough gravity would be working against it from the bottom anyway In city’s is it More detox.. More nausea well I mean using the cover that comes with it is sealed as well.. There’s not a tangible difference in the amount of bubbles My experience has taught me the complete opposite.,5,157

188,Because bubbles form when I use a mason jar and when I don’t either way I think it's legit..

189,"You could try blending it, but you'd have to mix water and there would be no way to separate the cream from the water, so you would end up with watered down cream.. Plus the blender itself would oxidize the hell out of it in the process so many of the nutrients would be destroyed in the process.. The only thing I could think of where you weren't destroying nutrients would be to shred the meat in a food processor and try to press it that way, but the force you would have to use would likely tear cheese cloth, so you would have to get ahold of stainless steel screens (or other metal screens or strainers that won't contaminate the meat) and use weights to press it into the screens and figure out how to catch the cream as it comes out the other side.. This would be a very time consuming, messy and inefficient method.. Might as well just pick out the meat and chew it at that point.",5,171

So there is some truth to the fact that those foods cooked would be easier to digest..

The only hurdle someone like this has to eating the above is the fear of bacteria which strengthens their justification to cook the food..

Both this argument and the one of vaccines that produce proteins eating antibodies makes sense.. This is just what I was asking, other explanations in addition to the simple ""autophagy is bad""..

I assume it was quite difficult to hunt in the middle of the night without any lights.,5,64

This week because of the temps the milk has still been fairly cold - Left it for 5 days and my milk hasn't really formed in kefir.. I will be now experimenting with keeping the milk inside at a warm room temp to try the reverse(in the guide if you keep it warm you can make a warm almost alcoholic form) My question is - Am I doing this right or am I wasting my time?.

It's difficult to know, so I would be cautious about it, and avoid it So shilajit is a no good point I'm just saying, someone being inspired by Aajonus doesn't mean all their content is Aajonus-approved, and it's rarely the case Well he said raw foods are better so if he ever had the chance to switch he would Yes, I made the post that they used to make it so I know Why is this the case Also unrelated but What is your personal opinion on not eating before bed?",5,262

Also most ppl that claim to be primal don't follow the diet properly, no juice, no cheese, not enough fat, not enough meat, alot just eat cooked meat and say they are primal..

You can also listen to the book here if you don't want to read it: video.. primaldiet.. net but overall Aajonus' instruction of ""if you can leave your fingers more than 4 seconds in the hot water without wanting to take it out"" is a good measure During the heat transfer from the water to the butter through the glass container a few degrees could be lost but I think that amount can vary depending on the type of glass, its width, etc.",5,151

This is why he tells us to eat protein every 5h or for some people even less.. So it is not something that applies to animals in nature and so on.. It's specific to a problem we have to fix, just like the bigger quantities of celery juice Idk, can just speculate, can say they hunted animals that were sleeping or active at night, also it depends on climates too, if u live in a super hot climate there wouldn't be much reason to be running around at day anyway bcz of the heat, i have no idea also since i don't have much experience in all climates and living in nature Also what would ""ancestors"" even mean?",5,217

Treatment and causes?",5,305
415,"A: Well, I did not want to get into any specific disease like that to a great extent.. But, psoriasis - like I said in the book - is basically the inability to reproduce cells to heal properly.. It could have been from too many x-rays, too many pollutants in the body, chemicals – anything that destroys the body’s ability to reproduce cells, to build new cells.. The body can call out cells from other areas and deliver them to that area as scar tissue; as live cells – like in endometriosis.. Those people who have liver spots – those are liver cells on the skin.",5,106
416,"The liver no longer utilizes them anymore because they are not functioning properly as a liver, but they will still function as a cell somewhere else in the body – so, they will act as a skin.. So, the body can send them there.. If your body can no longer have those particular hormones to call the cells out of other areas to go to that area to repair that one spot, you have got a problem with psoriasis – inability to heal wounds.. And it may be because the concentration of contamination is in that general area or the faulty ability of the lack of hormones to call out those cells to be transported.. Ok?",5,116
417,"Lots of fats are necessary and meats are necessary to correct it.. Eczema is similar?. Eczema is a fungus, psoriasis is partially fungus.. They will live and they are contagious if you have the elements that it wants to feed on in you're skin .. So it could be from that but you.",5,53
418,.. .. coffee and caffeine and theobromines from chocolates cause molds because there is a high amount of metal toxicity associated with caffeine.. It carries heavy metals with it; so does theobromine.. That's why they cause nerve damage.,5,38
419,"That's why it has an affinity to the neurological systems.. .. .. the brain.. So when they cook it those heavy metals - the mercury, the lead, all those trace heavy metals - become free radicals after cooking.",5,38
420,So then you've got the caffeine bound magnetically with these heavy metals.. That's why it causes that stimulation.. It pumps up adrenaline; it pumps up cortisone; it pumps up neurological hormones.. But it’s bad to have mold in your house so why is it good to eat ?. Did our ancestors have these ?,5,54
421,"Well everyone pees and sweats Bro, there is literally an answer For sure, but in mild forms Because mold in an artificial environment eat artificial things out this environment therefore it completely made of from toxic artificial things which are not utilised flawlessly by our bodies High meat is also in an artifical environment In our homes With artificial lighting Then  mold that grows on wood is fineV ?. ?. ?. Bro why do you overcomplicate things, feels like you’re 13-16 years old, then that’s okay.. Then put in under the natural light, what is the problem You are simply contradicting yourself You said it’s bad under an artificial environment.",5,110
422,"High meat is also in artificial environments when stored in your home What is ur logic Bro, is your high meat consuming a jar?. So mold on my wooden floor is fine?. If it’s completely natural wood so it is not a problem, but wooden boards that are used for construction are often impregnated with various chemicals to prolong their life, if this is your case then mold is probably toxic too because it has used the chemicals from these boards to reproduce itself Caffeine is a drug, that’s why it causes stimulation.. Why are you mixing it with mold and metals?. It’s just coincidence that they correlate?",5,108
423,"So psoriasis is due to high metal toxicity?. Is it from Aajonus?. You don’t get “Covid” while you’re stressed but you get psoriasis Actually my first message has the answer to your question.. You don’t notice symptoms because your body is nourished enough at the moment.. When you get to stress energy is channeled to handle stress situations Raw drt cheese by itself wouldn't digest anyway, with honey only it will digest and that might make u gain weight so if u want to lose weight, eat dry cheese by itself can you please tell me you just rub Kefir into your facial skin?",5,104

I thought natural sparkling waters had carbonation from nature, not from man adding it nice I mean, has anyone ever found sparkling water in nature?. Except the times he recommends sparkling water, like i remember something about oxygen absorption or something for lungs, or lymphatic system not sure No, i just tried a bunch of brands and observed how i felt from them and how they tasted, borjomi and borsec were the only ones that didn't give me any problems and made me the least dry So I guess we just have to confirm with companies whether they add truly natural carbonation or the toxic shit probably the latter lol hate to say it companies dgaf, money money money Ok👌 Aajonus liked grain fed beef, what does that mean?.

461,"It's very good that it's unvaxxed, but yeah, try to get never frozen as much as you can Natalia answer my question I did how much u wanna bet But why is the smell bad?. fat helps protect from toxins.. Body retaining fat is a natural protective response by the body to a toxic environment.. They were healthy not toxic like us today hence they were lower fat Ok makes sense that’s the very basic answer.. Aajonus may have glorified being fat too much - the way he presented the whole get fat stuff was definitely a bit off putting as a former meat head but the description above is consistent with his teachings Aajonus said this about Uranium But about high meat If it smells bad, by nature and by intuition wouldn’t we want to NOT eat it?",5,139
462,Is it okay to use salt and raw honey to scrub and exfoliate my skin Just curious if anything I learned from aajonus is that natural is always better.. just like raw fish solves the mercury problem.. I’m sure God designed raw spring water to be healthy for us too.. We just don’t always understand the mechanism.. Maybe something binds to the uranium Is eating oyster stores in tap water bad?,5,71
463,"Yeah I know what you mean.. If its totally natural like raw spring water then you'd think it would be healthy.. However, like poisonous plants there are poisonous elements in the Earth.. There is definitely spring water out there that isn't radioactive but I guess we just need to search for it then test it if we want to be sure.. if i injured myself very badly, like got into car accident, Instead of x-ray what am i supposed to do Can we eat egg membrane and shell?",5,88

No, Saladino is just sharing and analyzing the research of german and italian scientists.. I recommend watching the video ""I got an email this week saying, “Gerolsteiner got an F according to the water board.. ” I went to the site and Gerolsteiner got an “F” because they do not clean, filter or process the water at all so it’s got bacteria and everything in it..

Could check if you have leaky gut2.. otherwise can be caused by for example cooked protein intake that led to too much uric acid that deposited, tomatoes are recommended for this (can add lemon juice/honey) After 20 minutes it starts to dry, so yes that's more of the maximum amount of time What does aajonus say about gout Everytime I eat raw eggs I get a headache :( It is naturally carbonated by the spring So what about the sink.. Like i don’t wanna wash my hands in tap water, or clean my floor and windows in tap water I heard it has uranium.. But which is naturally occurring 20 minutes sounds excessive.",5,166

How often Scalp, the goal is to nourish the follicles Now it's confirmed On the scalp only or also hair Can i do the primal body cream on my hair Bone marrow and butter rubbed on scalp to thicken hair Raw meat with fat to speed up hair growth Lube formula and no shampoo for silky smooth hair Like using bone marrow on ur face isn’t “necessary” but it still helps so something like that Not for balding I don't know anything about that, I've never used it Like just to maintain hair health and growth Bone broth is really important if you are gonna be eating only cooked I did it a long time ago, cooked meat, (in salt and butter), milk and water..

599,"high in minerals Borsec doesn’t contain uranium , naturally carbonated he said to do it with sparkling water ''Acidic foods like lemon become alkaline after metabolism due to a process known as the 'alkaline ash' effect.. Here's a breakdown of this phenomenon:Initial Acidity: Foods like lemons are acidic outside the body due to their high content of citric acid.. This is what gives them their sour taste.. Digestion and Metabolism: When these foods are digested and metabolized by the body, they undergo chemical transformations.. The acids in the food, like citric acid, are broken down during digestion.",5,97
600,"Production of Alkaline Byproducts: The metabolism of acidic foods often produces byproducts that are more alkaline.. For example, citric acid from lemons is metabolized in the body to produce bicarbonate, which is an alkaline compound.. Alkaline Ash Theory: This process is sometimes referred to as the 'alkaline ash' theory.. The idea is that after digestion, the remaining 'ash' (metabolic waste) of the food can be acidic, neutral, or alkaline.. Foods like lemons, despite being acidic in nature, result in alkaline ash.",5,81
601,"Impact on Blood pH: It's important to note, however, that while the food may leave an alkaline residue, this does not have a significant impact on the overall pH of the body.. The human body has tightly regulated systems, especially the lungs and kidneys, to maintain a stable blood pH.. In summary, acidic foods like lemons can become alkaline after being metabolized due to the breakdown of their acidic components and the production of alkaline byproducts.. However, this does not mean they have a significant effect on altering the body's pH level.. '' Not sure if true or Aajonus approved but this is what it said I agree pork belly tastes much better than beef I'm not a scientist and don't know the details of the biochemical processes that occur like Aajonus did but I can ask GPT 4 that if you want Yes, someone pointed that out.",5,148

Perhaps safer from a toxicity POV, but trust me, nothing beats pork belly Does anyone know why Aajonus considers celery juice to be alkalizing when its ph-level is actually acidic outside of the body?.

621,"I remember I read it several times in his posts My aunt who is a nurse claimed that my organs will fail one by one and that i will die from eating raw meat when i'm 50 years old, but not earlier for some reason.. I just laugh at her, its pretty fun to listen to theories from germ theory believers.. I’m happy to answer any questions over a private chat this place isn’t the best for off topic discussions on religion.. Been there done that.. It was just a simple question, I'm not interested in a full on debate well you’re having a conversation now by asking a question anyway and it makes more sense to have it over a dm rather than turn a diet chat into a primal religion discussion where 100 other ppl chime in.",5,139
622,"You are being a bit presumptuous though, that’s not the basis for why I believe in what I do.. David trace amounts of naturally occurring are fine, and to quote Aajonus regarding a similar issue with naturally occurring fluoride in some water: we aren't supposed to drink a lot of it Sounds abit sus Yes Where did you figure that out?. There are very few people who actually believe it kills you quickly Crazy primal You gotta fix your gut microbiome and detox the brain It seems like Lina has a long bad history associated with her, I'm reading what Rom sent about her here lol Hahahaha But this is an extreme oversimplification, the diet has many treatments for these problems E coli = consume fecal matter and detox the colon with cheeseBrain heavy metals = moldy berries Sure.. Just my personal opinion and experience, being someone diagnosed ADD at 9yo, treated with amphetamines for 8 years, and now in my late 30s and still in trauma recovery.. I experience ADHD/ADD as a number of things in the diagnostic manual, including poor impulse control, limited awareness of time, limited social awareness, and a few other things I'm probably forgetting.",5,199
623,"These are all the things that happen when to our nervous system when we're frightened.. We focus on quick, reactive action, we freeze and dissociate, we prioritize the present moment and grossly undervalue long-term goals and rewards because: survival.. When this state becomes chronic, we're doing this stuff so much we're struggling to do long-term planning and the other stuff that ADHD/ADD people are known for.. It's chronic sympathetic nervous system arousal, usually accompanied by the freeze state or parasympathetic dissociation coping mechanism.. Certain apps on my phone have to be a certain color, food in my fridge has to be aligned a certain way.",5,105
624,It ruins my life Same with me.. But OCD is far worse Maybe that's why I'm incapable of sitting down to read a book from start to finish lol I actually have severe OCD and ADHD too when I think about it can i do to fix that Other than being on raw diet and following hot barhs what else?. It would be helpful Yeah OCD is tough man Genuinely curious Toxins are involved.. But it's relational too.. definetly define rly That's a fantasy of simplicity.,5,86
625,It's a chronic state of sympathetic nervous system excitement.. Heavy metals in the brain and low e coli only supplements i don’t think you can get vitamin toxicity from whole foods unless your eating extreme amounts i think Adhd is caused by Metals I would love for somebody to show me where Aajonus said eating too much raw liver is harmful due to nutrient overload.. I always thought that was propaganda Haha Can you elaborate on the “chronic state of SNS excitement?. Being completely honest Nothing is genetic.. Even Aajonus said this.,5,92
626,"All disease is either from malnutrition or toxicity (and trauma if it's mental) It’s hard to convey my point but if you understand then good and aajonus used it and got the most amazing results from it, so it doesn't matter Sounds like you've adapted to an inconsistent caregiver or caregiving environment as a child, and you're trying to stabilize those parts of yourself by exerting a lot of control over your environment.. I don't think I'm autistic because I have social skills and empathy.. But OCD and ADHD for sure are possibilities The diagnoses are kind of useless IMO.. We're all on a bunch of spectrums.. If something like OCD or ADD is in the way of something you want to achieve in your life, then it matters to address it, diagnosis or not.",5,135
627,"Otherwise, it's all good.. I definitely might have some questionable and irrational compulsions and obsessions that interfere with my life.. Not too different from what Gibby described But I always thought it was just me being orderly and organized If you don't mind it, it's not an issue IMO.. I'm definitely OCD about a lot of things.. I see it as a frightened part of myself that's still trying to protect me from inconsistent caregivers.",5,75
628,"I also might have severe OCD related to toxins.. I analyze literally everything whether it's toxic I think you're supposing that health is objective.. But health is just ""the state you need to do a thing"".. All things will have costs, and those costs will eat away at certain limited resources.. There's no ""optimal health"" no matter what Scott or anyone else claims; we just spend our lives trying to do things, and it costs us exactly what it costs to get there.",5,83
629,"If we don't pay, we don't get to go.. Yeah, that's maybe one of the biggest challenges I see with people doing the diet.. Not addressing the parts of ourselves that are ""driving"" our dietary approach.. Those parts aren't always balanced or moderate or careful in their approach.. Infancy is easily the most vulnerable time as a child, where a lot of the deepest and most persistant hurts developed.",5,69

I’ve been on the raw diet for 4-5 months so far.. Everything is genetic.. If genetics are real, we're all running on it, all the time.",5,62
631,"I think mental illness specifically is a combination of environmental toxins and relational wounds.. You can't cure a powerful and necessary survival strategy!. But you can help yourself to continue to develop and grow through it.. Diet can be one part of that, but no, I don't think Aaj knew how to heal trauma completely with diet.. He certainly lived with and made the most of a number of debilitating traumatic limitations.",5,72
632,"What is this genetic inheritance factor you're talking about?. That’s very smart, but what if it’s just generally unhealthy?. Like does Ocd affect our health as well?. Health is relative to goals.. A strength athlete needs one version of health for their goals, a hospital worker might need another, and a raw meat eater might need another.",5,57
633,"I think it comes down to how do you want to live, and what's possible today with where you're starting from.. Let’s say OCD and ADHD don’t affect me in any way at all , but if it affects my actual health i would care.. Does it?.

637,"Bad on excess.. Aajonus didn't promote them from what I read (but maybe it was old materials).. I think it is possible to get too much detox going with organs, especially if eaten in smoothies and other combinations that hide the taste.. The way I understand, muscle is mostly adequate and organs are mainly to target your own specific organs' healingDon't worry about eating too much organs, hypervitaminosis and all that nonsense, just enjoy your food Has anyone here ever used clay on their skin?. If so reply to this message Are u suggesting organs are good or bad in excess They inject them and do tests on them Do you think maybe the excess copper is more easily detoxed on a primal diet and that's why we don't see people on primal diet having tooth decay/tooth problems in their children?",5,141
638,"Another thing that Aajonus got right was organ meats.. When I read we want to live, it gave me the impression he does not think we should eat a lot of organ meats?. Maybe that was wrong?.

He was sent to a juvenile center by his parents I’ve never had any of those really Yes this too, that's why I haven't dabbled yet But I suspect if you're eating organs plain, you'll get put off by the taste before this happens..

Some vitamins r fat soluble Okay, idk about that specifically.",5,88
645,"Idk, I think even healthy foods can be ""too much"" and thus harmful, especially when we're loaded with toxins.. The hypervitaminosis they talk about is mostly from supplemental vitamins Yes I agree Very flawed Logic Right there.. If a Person tells you that he went out and ate something that is Not Part of the diet then obviously Right then and there he decided that this would be enjoyment for him in that Moment.. In that case forcing yourself to vomit it out is ridiculous.. If you Are the guy who enjoys sticking to the diet 365 days a year then that is your Type of enjoyment.",5,107
646,"You can not debate about the desires of another Person.. When it comes to me I decided that roughly 1 a month I will eat something that is Not Part of the diet..

I see it as Food that is not nourishing that I can still easily tolerate because I have built up my health to not worry about it.",5,81

Is abusing your body with poison a treat?. Your logic is quite flawedI don't see slave processed food as a ""treat"" and I really enjoy this raw diet because it makes me healthy and nourished so I feel no need to ""cheat"" (cheating implies you gain something from it)The only real reason I see why you would not do the diet fully is if you want to fit in with your normie slaves that eat junk.",5,134

658,This comes from seeing all the diseases around us.. But those diseases did Not appear overnight and they also did not just develop within one life time.. Auto immune conditions are multiple generations having defeiciencies or extended periods of trauma to their organs which is then passed on to next Generations..

Some of us have what you might call an advanced soul or intuition that naturally sees through psyops, even when we were kidsFor example, I was never the npc that got good grades in school, defended vaccines like they're society's greatest achievement or was horrified of raw food.. I always have this natural curiosity where I love to research every angle about everything and I don't care what others think of me A better question: how are they not?. 😂 Most successful people are high school dropouts who learn life the hard way Governments have clear interest in slaves.. They create indoctrination centers masked as an educational system, and then they trick you that it's for your own goodThat's why the biggest npcs are usually college/university ""educated"" (indoctrinated) pplThe word education in the context of school should always be replaced with indoctrination and then you'll get a clear image of what school is word is an incredibly powerful tool For money?",5,238

There is obviously a presence of elite education that will help you to live in given circumstances.. Primal diet is a part of it, That's complete horseshit Ok so zero lol Processed food tastes like plastic if your body is properly nourished Have you ever considered the possibility that some or most people here are actually larping as primals, and don't do the diet in actuality?.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not some religious leader condemning you if you don't do the diet, it's your life and you can do whatever you want I just think if you actually do the diet, you will experience benefits you never imagined were possible It's not about doing or not doing the diet, it's just a reality that the food you've been eating for 20+ years of your life will not become disgusting to you because you started eating raw.. You just simply choose to not any of it anymore The problem with this is you're assuming that is purely psychological, it's actually biochemical It's both By using the word ""biochemical"" I can already tell you are a sv3rige follower Then explain me..

I know the word health isn’t objective, my point is, if OCD didn’t impact my day to day life and prevent me from doing something I want, is it still going to, for example, eat away at my brain and cause problems in my health as in my longevity and how long i live?.

If you're doing what you want to do with each day, than you won't have regrets.. So how do i get rid of OCD and ADHD?. Well, IMHO the first step is to stop thinking of it as something you can get rid of.. The diagnosis is symptoms, and the symptoms are just your body and mind doing what they do best: surviving.",5,114
690,"So you can change the symptoms, but you don't want to get rid of the system that is surviving this way.. By pathologizing symptoms, you've bought into a mindset that sets you against yourself; modern medicine takes full advantage of this fantasy to sell you self-hatred labelled as cures.. It's an addictive medicine model, and it won't heal relational wounds.. Nutrition can go a long way towards healing environmental toxicity, but it won't completely heal relational wounds IME, except maybe relational wounds around food.. But relational therapies will address OCD and ADD at the root, helping you to reunite consciously with the parts of yourself that started surviving by these methods before you were able to care for yourself as you can now.",5,123
691,"There are a variety of relational therapies.. PD is definitely one for food and many other body issues; the whole ethos of PD is one of respecting the body and listening to and caring for it..

I think it really just depends on your goals and your current mentality as to what will be the next step for you at this time.",5,86

Ngmi boys Eat one cooked meal per week, you'll still progress plenty I'm not talking about cooked meat I'm talking about processed carbs Like i feel so great eating raw only But i keep craving delicious food You can still make plenty of progress eating a cheat meal once a week or every 2 weeks..

Dementia is usually caused by aluminum and Alzheimer’s usually by mercury.. It used to be believed that the majority of Alzheimer’s was caused by aluminum, too, until researchers at the University of Calgary demonstrated how neurons are destroyed by mercury [transcriber’s note: Drs.",5,91
743,"Fritz Lorscheider and Naweed Syed - https://youtu.. be/BtFsy0rQsak].. They showed that the neurological damage done by mercury is identical to that seen in Alzheimer’s.. Aluminum does not create those lesions.. Mercury comes from vaccines, coal power plant emissions, fish, fillings.",5,40
744,"Now with the increasing contamination, you’d have to eat a lot of butter and cheese.. I did tests in 1988-92 showing that 92% of mercury in swordfish left the body.. This is many years later and the levels grow every year because we keep burning coal to produce energy.. You have to eat cheese and a lot of butter and maybe coconut cream before and with the fish.. In one of my last two newsletters I have a lime formula to help remove heavy metals.",5,85

I’ve spent the last two months aching right here.. It’s so sore and hurts so bad sometimes I even had to change which hand I use for the computer mouse.. And I started getting wrinkled, sagging skin all over the place within about four months after the injections and exploding tissue all over my body so it looked like I had been in a shrapnel explosion.. What I do to reduce those is I have a kind of sports formula: a cup of whey, a cup of blueberries, 2 oz pineapple, 5 medium or 4 large eggs, 2 tbl lime juice, 2 tsp lemon juice, 1-3 tbl raw ACV, and then add enough milk to give you a quart.",5,147
746,This will remove heavy metals and toxicity.. This is the current formula; I keep experimenting.. It works a little bit better on the vaccine toxicity stored in my arm than the earlier sports formula.. ACV carries those particular amino acids used in chelation therapy.. So why do they use these false amino acids that they produce by processing to the hilt with hexane which is either gasoline or kerosene?,5,69
747,"Even though these chelation drugs may have removed some loose metals like mercury, cadmium, or lead, most of the chelation therapy contaminants themselves don’t come out of the body.. ACV has three of those four particular amino acids and the lime juice has the other.. So the combination takes care of it without putting frickin’ poisons in your body.. But they don’t make money if you’re just going to your food cabinet and getting food.. They want to put this chemical into you - even alternative doctors – saying they want to get rid of these metals.",5,97
748,"But the contamination they create is astronomical.. So you feel better for the first few years and then after that you’ll go downhill…unless you’re from Krypton.. Q: [unclear] formula did you say?. A: No, one to two tablespoons of honey.. I don’t like too much honey in mine.",5,48

Maybe uranium is what makes the others taste delicious😋 Its marketed as wild unless thats a lie Then it's probably not naturally carbonated I tried sparkling mountain valley (artificial carbonation) and didnt have much after taste im assuming from its low mineral content.,5,94

757,After the week i’ve had this cheese out for more than a month.. i had to make sure there was no part of it that was touching the plate.. any moisture on the cheese will cause it to grow mold.. you have to make sure the cheese is in a dry area with a lot of circulation.. and hang it in some way where no moisture can be trapped.,5,69

767,"That's the first time I hear about that 🤔 Cheese is dried curds that separated from whey during milk fermention But if you leave buttermilk out in room temp will it not eventually ferment?. Yes, but I never heard Aaj talk about buttermilk or its benefits so I just throw it out or drink it It's interesting how he never talked about it.. Liquid buttermilk has properties like whey according to aajonus If you leave buttermilk out to ferment it will develop a curd, however it is very delicate.. You could probably dry it into a cheese with multiple layers of butter muslin if you are gentle with it.. I just fed some curdled buttermilk to my chickens a this morning Is 105 degrees still the max temperature for baths?",5,130

You are using the term health to mean some objective metric of functionality and longevity.. However we don't simply operate on rest, digest and move about.. We're also thinking, dreaming, emoting, relating, etc.",5,132
775,"and these needs all have their own constraints and values, many of which are opposed to each other.. You will find this out if you live long enough; you can't have everything.. That's why I define health as the capacities needed to achieve personal goals, since this is how one might average all the conflicting needs and decide which ones to sacrifice for others.. Regarding mental health, OCD itself doesn't shut off parts of the brain; it's a symptom profile.. I think OCD occurs when parts of the mind are acting defensively to relational injuries.",5,95
776,"These defenses are in large part to protect us from socially adverse reactions, maybe true to the present or just true to the past, that would threaten survivability.. So the mind keeps certain feelings numbed and hidden (denial), other activities compulsive and repetitive (managing) and some even stronger compulsions ready for greater immediate threats (firefighters).. The result is a system that's working on survival, but making sacrifices to survive an adverse social/relational environment.. There's a lot going into it, it's not just one symptom or issue but rather a system that depends on many parts to optimize survival.. The larger pattern would be diagnosed as CPTSD, or complex PTSD, IMHO.",5,110
777,"And yes, it definitely hurts functionality and longevity, but we don't get to survive later if we don't survive now.. I’m just kidding I’ll watch it first before saying that Why don't you email frank Tufano and see if he's willing to send you butter without ice?. Because his dairy is fresh, but he packs so much ice it freezes en route Especially in the winter.. Get insulation but no ice packs if you can.. I don’t live in the US but are there no better options than ordering from Frank?",5,91
778,"Guy is so fake I wouldn’t trust him with my food Okay - you said at the end ""it definetly hurts functionality and longevity"", how so?. Didn't  you just say before that it wouldnt take years off my life?. Buy a cow!. I mean.. .",5,45
779,"whateverA little weak minded but not everybody needs to be strict primalIf she’s happy she’s happy it is what it is Do you think physical toxins hurt functionality and longevity?. Social/relational toxins are the same way.. We can adapt to McDonalds and we adapt to inconsistent caregivers, but our survival comes at a long term cost.. However, some people want the lifestyle that comes with eating McDonalds, and some people want the lifestyle that comes with inconsistently caring relationships, and so it doesn't matter to them enough to change it.. I think I said earlier that I think life is about quality over quantity; if you live a shorter life with OCD but you focus on what's important to you, then it's a life well spent IMO.",5,127

How do you know this?. Like all foods are different, how does one temperature apply to multiple foods no basis for this but I would prioritize the peppercorn 3x a week then and just rotate the other 2 when not doing the peppercorn Why?",5,142
781,"He said to peppercorn every 3 days which is 2x a week basically technically 3 idk Dont understand I can eat like 30 oysters at once If it's the same ratio as bathwater it should be finebut too much salt externally even if it doesn't get through the skin, not very good To be fair most orders include ice packs in the boxes regardless of where you buy from You have to put it in the fridge for it to harden I’m asking if i should leave it out or put it in the fridge For best results An easier way to make “butter” would be to just buy Indian pure ghee, shipped in tins from India (Amul, RKG, and several other brands).. .. Ghee is cream churned into butter (to remove the lactose and casein), then gently heated to further clarify it, the remaining lactose will rise and is skimmed off, leaving a clear milk fat called ghee.. Depending on the room temperature, it can be solid or liquid, putting it in a cold place (fridge or if room temperature is cold enough), the ghee in the tin will be a soft solid like butter.. .",5,197
782,"So if I love cream & hate butter I can just have cream?. It’s plant fat, keeping it outside, unless your room temperature is cold enough, will turn it sour (oxidation).. .. Keep it in the fridge would probably be best.. .",5,42
783,"and without preservatives means you would also probably need to consume it within 1-2 days.. .. You talking about coconut milk (squeezed coconut flesh), which is liquidy?. The cream is the fat that floats on top - not a lot.. .",5,41
784,"I use this ghee all the time This is the other brand I mentioned U know it isn't heated above 104?. Ghee isn’t boiled, it’s gently heated just to remove the remaining lactose (hence the name clarified butter) There are stringent requirements for the production of AGMARK ghee in India, these 2 brands meet those requirements.. .. Alr Would eating raw clams cause toxicity?. I don't get oysters around my state for some reason.",5,74
785,"only clams.. Around my city* Who's habibi?. It's still cooked most of the timeit would have to he heated before 40C to be raw Did I get trolled ⛧ Nothing Just you laughed Made me insecure Ohhhh I see Nice emotes Clams do have non ionically bound heavy metals in their meat according to aajonus, unlike oysters who build all the cauterised non ionically bound heavy metals into the shell.. If they are a good source the clams would still be beneficial though I wouldn’t eat as many clams as you want like you can with oysters however 3-6, 30 minutes after a meat meal I use ghee for my cooking anyways, if one wanted totally raw, probably best to stick to raw cream direct from a good farm, there wouldn’t be any raw cream in any stores, or raw butter which would probably be made from pasteurised cream.. .",5,150
786,"Coconut cream is always liquidy man I made this coconut cream myself I wouldn’t say the same for the more expensive “artisanal” ghee sold in plastic bottles in organic stores That pack of commercial coconut cream is like water?. Then it might have been diluted WITH water, hardening it might render ice crystals.. .. 100% pure coconut cream is the cream layer scooped off freshly squeezed coconut flesh, the more watery part is called coconut milk (usually commercially thickened with carageenan, and sold as “coconut cream”) The farms I order from, I have to specifically say no ice packs each time I order and luckily they leave them out Pure coconut cream should be thick in consistency, like dairy cream can frozen meat be turned into high meat?. It wasn't why she didn't stick to it, it was just a side note lol yo guys does anyone here know if Meadow Ridge farms butter is frozen?",5,156
787,"I don't know her at all.. I was just doing my routine ""raw primal diet"" YouTube search 😂 It was a broke person trying to start this diet lol how long does coconut cream take to harden ?. ?. Most commercial store bought butter is frozen for storage and transported, only put into the chillers for retail sales.. .",5,59
788,In fridge or freezer?. A few hours?. Is there any farm that ships unfrozen butter?. Or not a single one Probably only if you churn cream into butter yourself.. .,5,30
789,"I have sent you an important message, come to DM For it to make commercial sense, and profitability, it has to be done in larger quantities, and stored for shipping and sales It’s a very easy thing to do at home, in small quantities.. .. The difference probably isn’t that great, just a matter of slightly higher Omega6 than Omega3 content, but still wayyyyy lower O6 than most commercial processed food products that use plant oils.. .. I know Aajonus said grain fed cow products are still good but what exactly would I be looking for in regard to what the cows are consuming?",5,104
790,"What grains exactly?. Of course cream is the lesser processed product, churning cream separates the milk fat from the buttermilk, the latter which contains milk sugar (lactose), and milk protein (casein).. .. Those who aren’t lactose intolerant can probably thrive on whole cream.. .",5,44
791,"those who are lactose intolerant would probably do better with just the milk fat.. .. Neo Whoops, my bad.. .. coconut cream would probably only harden in the freezer.",5,29
792,".. I’m confused, i want it to harden, because right now it’s liquid, like water Coocnut oil?. I’m talking about cream Just putting the glass bottle of coconut oil in the coldest part of your fridge (typically near the back vents), for a few hours, the clear liquid will turn opaque.. .. Do i put it in the fridge or where I wouldn’t be surprised supermarket cream is frozen for storage and transportation as well.",5,75
793,".. and supermarket cream also contains additives, mostly carrageenan.. .. Cold room requirements will be to freeze the butter Why can't we just have cream, why does it have to be butter.. I read we want to live & now reading recipes.",5,42
794,"But if anyone wanna know rabies isn't real.. Obviously viruses are not contagious, so what if I understand correctly is that dogs foam out of their mouth because their digestive tracking is dissolved, so their spit comes out the mouth and not in the body.. So this proves to me that bacteria & parasites are being recognized as healing disease & exposure to them is good, and doctors are aware of it but it will break their worldview to admit it so instead they act like these ""revolutionary"" treatments are unique.. But in reality if everyone with stomach issues ate raw and got exposed to more ""pathogens"" then their body will heal.. I mean realistically if you eat raw meat for the rest of your life I think it’s technically impossible to not get parasites IBS also includes constipation I think It sounds the same lol Irritable Bowel Syndrome Isn’t that the same as IBS right?",5,156
795,"Yeah but parasites are supposed to be janitors of sick/damaged cells/toxins.. Then they die / leave in your intestines when they're done feeding and infect something else No it is an actual disease in digestive tract whereas IBS is more like stomach discomfort.. I have Crohn's but I just could not do that.. People also get e coli fecal transplant Yes but I’m saying because you’re scared of them 😂 The thing they say is rabies does not come from any animal biting.. Also doctors say after the bite it can take weeks, months or years before rabies symptoms show up.",5,101

797,"But I definitely do not want to ever risk getting bit I don’t think you’ll even see them until after they’ve passed through stool Dogs are not snakes, they don't have venom..

Like nigga your lives would be fucked without primal, appreciate that Stop being gay You'd still be spending thousands of dollars on medical bills you're just in time for the latest, and hopefully the last, now all the people who I supported turned against me, it's  time to cut it all off madmen There's no light without dark It never ends big boss I'm mirin u son I don't usually ass-lick but, a lot of people don't deserve your expertise at all Lol did you even read what I said.. Whole point flew over ur head The best thing is to use water My message was in response to W I know we’re on the same page Purafide is probably the best toilet paper/paper towel brand My goal is to reduce toxicity within practical means so that would be good enough Its not practical to wash ur ass with water?",5,190
844,"Or to use a cotton towel to dry ur meat instead of a paper one No its not *for me* I dont dry my meat, but if i did i’d want to use something disposable and not have bloody rags in my kitchen and laundry So i’ll expose myself to toxic bambo and let my body detox it😉 Everyone who is in the group Primal Life has to leave it right now.. Reason:The owner Erik, who used to be sensible, and with whom I worked with a lot, very unfortunately has gone mad and harasses a woman after she refused to send him photos, and nudes.. There is just no other way to describe it, as cringe as it sounds.. For an entire year, Erik has been harassing this woman using terms such as: demon, the worst faggot, herpes, .. .",5,141
845,".. a bunch of names, and getting other people to do this along with him.. There is some background story, will of course I will have to explain again in detail, but not right now, i'm too tired of going through more than 10h of this already.. On top of that they are all trying to gaslight me about it and I've really had enough of this f*ing circus.. This is a shameful turn of events and at first I was trying to make it so that we would both just go our own ways, but it isn't working, and I'm not going to stand idle anymore, as it keeps getting worse and there is no hope of resolving it, all has been tried for weeks.",5,126
846,"The whole group itself, most (not all, but most) of the other active members/admins there are non-stop running a harassment campaign as well.. The worst part of it is I helped that group and his owner Erik for countless months, given months of my life, against other, even more f*ed up people, I literally became the target of harassment in his place, I took on ALL THE WEIGHT OF IT by helping them deal with those f*ed up people, who did false accusations of pedophilia, and many other such things, and now they turned against that woman and because they refused to stop, and I was not accepting this behaviour, completely contrary to all I worked towards, they also turned against me, after all I did to help them, just because Erik cannot get over a woman rejecting him.. That guy used to not act like this, but now, he does, and I could not get him to stop at all.. All this disruption prevents these online spaces from functioning correctly, NORMALLY, with just regular normal decency, slows me down non-stop from doing my damn work of providing quality content, so now it is time to completely cut off the people who cannot stop themselves from acting problematic (even if they were once reasonable).. So, everyone who wants to stay in this group @primaldiet, leave Primal Life (if you are there) right away, otherwise, if you stay there, you are supporting a group that turned into an embarrassing cesspool, as unfortunate as it is to realize for me who did so much for it, and also has good memories in it, I will remove you from here, and you can instead be with them while they are non-stop harassing people for ridiculous reasons, and for some of them, no matter if they mean bad or not, acting purely insane.",5,309

This is the guy I had to ban today, I hope everyone in his group left it Since he deleted our entire conversation to hide all the help I gave him for free and how much of a hypocrite he is, I have all of it saved.. Ended up one of the worst people I've had to deal with, gleefully gaslighting me because he thinks he has some power, but he nothing, in real life, and even online..

We humans can't get along with each other This ground completely fell off the cliff If you put anywhere around 100-150g it's enough Do we put dry or pre moist clay in the baths Aaj said pre moist clay is 3x more effective but if its for exfoliation it wont work if its pre moistened most of the time I use raw coconut oil to oil pull yes.",5,265

I still don't want to ever see them IRL.. I actually am also warming up to the moldy berries idea and really want to try one, and high meat as well but not as much.. I see so it's already less of a problem relatively, it should keep getting better Bizarre terminally online behavior tbh.",5,104

I cut a centimeter off the bottom of the stalks, add water, and put them in the sunlight.. They’ll continue to suck up the water for a week or longer..

Is this a normal reaction you have to deal with in public?. Idk it’s just a random Reddit x-ray, who knows even how real it is Lol But if you made a ferment with honey in it like a yogurt, it might not work very well High meat smells like berries to me now, i seems to have gotten used to the smell..

867,From my experience they always ask what i'm drinking.. They can't comprehend it's raw milk or milk at all because it doesn't have a label on it.. If i drank pasteurized from a carton they probably wouldn't react the same way or find it weird.. How do they know it’s raw lol Yea i guess you're right.. I've even met people who think drinking raw milk in public is strange.,5,70

AAJ said that You're going to be stuck in this loophole for a very long time my friend Sorry to tell you genuinely I figfuired out the answer Just now aaj implies that everybody gonna buy clay in powder, because like most of the people cannot afford to just go and take the clay wet out of the soil therefore they gonna buy the clay as a powder.. when you buy it as a powder, obviously it’s not useful that much, so you need to kind of get it back into the natural state by moistening it Dude oh my god You never would use dry clay, to eat or to put on ur skin Pre moisten means you leave it in water for at least 4 days Moisten means just add to liquid Pre moisten is different than just mositening it.. If you're consuming the clay yes it should be premoistened other than that I don't think it matterrs what's the problem Also in certain recipe it should be pre moistened seriously For the balding protocol He said pre moistened clay For other things he says sun dried, which isnt pre moistened so i wouldnt reccomend pure comedy right there They are two different things so that's a yes?.

I think Aajonus said it’s mostly fearmongering and BS and that they don’t leave the intestines and expand into muscles or whatever No but I was trying to say it took away the constant fear of parasites, bacteria, if something is cooked all the way, if the cutting board/knife were cleaned after touching meat, etc lol.",5,101

""last question"" nigga who you fooling Yeah that's too much now, I already answered U never answered how many times a week I said as many as you want and explained how you decide that Alr.. What about the fertile egg question You can also do this, just alternate them.. one time do egg fertile egg, another do another combination he givesabout the fertile egg: it's not actually the fertile part that matters.",5,94
945,"aajonus mentioned that it was just to ensure that the hen is free range, so a free range non fertile egg works What does the egg do for the face tho?. He doesn't say the minute differences between egg butter etc, he said fermented milk is the best out of them though.. and that egg is very good as a shaving cream kefir goated Do i still need to mix papaya juice with the clay if I dont have acne scars?. Cause he said it was for acne scars.. or does it have other purpouses as well ?",5,98
946,"(this is the actual final last question.. I will tip you extra) i used to use milk for shaving cream too he said to use milk/fermented milk as shaving cream , he also said an egg was good, and coconut cream was good.. but then he said coco cream was bad many good choices I'm gonna tell you something in practice, coconut cream is so time consuming to make and you can only get it from very few places truly raw, and it's not cheap Gibby If he said milk and egg was good okay at least it's about something else lol Tbh, the reason im asking, yes, is OCD.. ACtually the entire reason I am even into health is OCD.. the only reason im on a raw primal diet is OCD.",5,132
947,".. .. .. .. no need these details don't come up often Keeps everything in the community tho if you choose to make brand new channels i made healthfully for that So does the coco cream soap work enough to pull toxins, or its better to add some coco cream to the bone marrow/butter mixture to do it even further.",5,60
948,"or would that cause extra detox @ChrisTranchita I would say no It wouldn't be as effective Keep the bone marrow, butter mixtures all  seperate one at a time Yeah but nobody used Aaj said use both together But never talked about coco cream ok then do that and keep coco seperate nigga you are not even balding so i don't see the point preventing it also its not just for balding mositurizes scalp , good for the skin Makes hair grow faster and healthier https://www.. youtube.. com/watch?. v=whuny39Og0Q&t=324s And mix them Kinda like discord Have you tried telegram topic channels?. or we gonna start a whole group just for this id be bombarding his email 50 emails a day 😂 maybe humans in the future will find out a way to resurrect from the dead?",5,135
949,"Aaj never even explained why he said to put clay and acv on face that mfer would ghost you 50th clay email of the day what time of the day is it best to put clay in my asshole sir yeah ok guys i'm gonna read it now Also last question: he said coco cream is good for pulling toxins from scalp and brain, is using a coco cream soap enough?. 10% fermented coco cream 90% water, use it as shampoo daily.. bro such abstract questions just make the coco cream and put it on the scalp No makes my hair way too oily bro guys i'm reading now please stop Sorry just do this, by itself The ocd is through the fucking roof Soaps filled with water are not going to have the same effect but i dont see whats wrong with mixing coco cream and butter/marrow i'm almost done replying Rom yea I know, but I cant use the pure coconut cream, I have to dilute it, or else my hair will get very oily.. thats why im gonna use it seperately as well for more detox (if thats ok with u and its primal approved) Bro just do it Fuck it Yolo You already know Youve read the books - How long to leave the clay/acv mixture on the skinYou remove it when it starts to dry.. - Where to apply the clay/acv mixture (face, body, butthole, WHERE?",5,241
950,")Scalp and skin.. It is to attract toxins so anywhere there are toxins.. There can be more toxins in the scalp and face because there is the brain there that emits a lot of toxins.. People also get wrinkles in their face first because of that, the body stripping fats off the first to deal with toxins locally.. That being said, it's not the only thing he says to use on the skin.",5,73
951,"He says fermented milk is the most effective, even more than butter/bone marrow mix, because it's predigested, and reverses wrinkles the fastest for example (so it feeds the skin very well).. He said one woman with grey skin, and many wrinkles rejuvenated her face very fast doing this consistently.. You are asking where to put it, but you do not have to put it anywhere, if you do not have a problem.. Just taking hot baths clears the skin and if you eat properly it will also be properly fed.. So unless you notice an issue you shouldn't need to cover your whole body in clay paste.",5,107
952,"Or if you want to go that way just sleep in clay mud baths lmao.. Do one night clay mud bath, the other night high meat bath, the other night cream bath.. .. .. you will have the best skin the world.",5,42
953,"A bath is not the same because the clay is completely dilluted in water.. And it's dealing with toxins in there.. And if you increased clay concentration until the point where its a bunch of clay applying on your skin, then you are literally in a mud bath.. Which you can find.. And yes a clay bath I call it mud because of the texture and everyone is familiar with this idea.",5,72
954,"So the answer is, there is no amount of time to use it.. It all depends on your problem.. If you do not have skin problems then you do not need it much or at all, provided you do baths + eat very well.. You could do it all the time if you wanted as long as clay doesn't dry.. But that's not a good use of your time better eat more fat.",5,73
955,"Example if you have a more severe, deep, kind of problem:""If your tendon is not attaching, you have some metal, formaldehyde, chemicals or something where it won’t join.. Just like an ulcer.. Ulcers won’t heal as long as they’re contaminated.. Once the contamination is gone, the cells can fuse together.. """"Mix clay with coconut oil (or olive oil which is second best) and a tiny bit of water and into a firm paste and pack it on that area and cover with a damp piece of sock or cloth.",5,89
956,"""""You don’t want the clay to dry because it will damage the skin.. You want to pull it out through the skin.. Use at night, all day long.. ""Do you have this anywhere?. If not, no need to bother.",5,39
957,"The complete base protocols covers all.. Ok but what about the clay, he doesn't say here if it's moist or not.. He doesn't even give any proportions here.. In the book he gives more so I will post that however.. However you can still see he says it should be covered with a damp piece of cloth, so that will moisten the clay.",5,63
958,"So whether the clay is pre moistened or not, that will moisten it.. So it should be fine to use pre-moistened clay for this topical use too.. So you can keep clay from drying by having something moist over it.. That is the same with injury bandages, where he says you can add a slice of watermelon over the meat layer and wrap it all.. Now some recipes he gaveFrom WWTL in Beauty tips:""Several times a week,applying onto the skin,a thin paste made of 1 teaspoon sun-dried powered claymixed with 1½ tablespoons raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar""In this one the clay is not pre-moistened, he mentions powdered, very explictly.",5,109
959,"And he gives the the proportions there.. But in another Q&A, he warns about it: A: Basically it's a cancerous tumor.. Q: Yeah.. A: You put pineapple, take a little piece of pineapple over there, rub it on only once a day.. Next day you put raw apple cider vinegar on it.",5,52
960,"Next day pineapple, next day apple cider vinegar and let it eat away at it a little at a time.. What your body is doing is putting dead cells there that you're not dissolving inside the body.. It's just a building there.. Better on the skin than in your lungs or in your lymphatic system or any of the liver, glands or any of those.. Better right there.",5,68
961,I've had a lot of people who've had their cancers right here.. Q: What about mixing apple cider vinegar with clay?. A: Not a good idea.. Because the clay is going to rip the fats out of it and the fats need to react with the apple cider vinegar.. You're going to damage the tissue.,5,55
962,"So just pineapple, apple cider vinegar rotated?. and that seems to be because, it's on a cancerous tumor, which seems to be more delicate.. He doesn't want the fats to come out of it.. It's not regular skin.. So in the book he must be talking of applying on regular skin only.",5,52
963,"but clay together with vinegar are not the only combination he givesThere is clay and olive oil for example as wellIn WWTL under Acne:""Topically: Applying a mixture of 1 tablespoon good mineral water, ½teaspoon powdered sun-dried clay and a drop of stone-pressed olive oilsoothes and usually prevents scars.. Or apply some Primal Facial BodyCare Cream (from my recipe book).. Or simply applying a dab ofunheated honey soothes and promotes healing.. ""Here also, powdered clay.. Shampoo:""Use coconut cream as soap.",5,79
964,"If you do not want your hair to be so oily from using coconut cream as shampoo, simply let it ferment out of the refrigerator until it turns pink and dilute it with water.. Then wet your hair before applying the diluted coconut cream""And this is the way to prepare moistened clay with proportions:""Put 1¼ cups of clay and 1 cup water into a 2-cup jelly jar.. There’s a lot of air space in clay.. Once you mix it, it will reduce down to maybe even less than 2 cups and you may have to add a little bit more clay and water.. It should be the consistency of freshly made plaster of Paris.",5,114
965,"Then you let that sit; you can start using it straight away.. ""and then:""Cover and let it stand for 5 days in a dark cupboard.. When premixed and aged, clay is 3 times more effective""but he also says it's still effective before 5 days, it just gets better.. that being said he refers mostly to bacteria activity with the moist clay aging, which may be less relevant for topical use.. it's definitely necessary when consuming it to avoid it adhering to intestinal walls and damaging them.",5,86
966,"yes i replied  this before man, why are we going over it again then just do that before i  read, just clarifying, its fine to apply raw coco cream to scalp like 5x a week?. or it would cause too much detox it's fine ok Here are my questions for this:1:You say to apply the clay/acv mixture to scalp and face, so for your scalp you say to use pre moistened clay mixed with ACV, did aaj ever say this?. Bc aaj says to use ""sun dried clay"" mixed with ACV on the face.. So I dont think he is referring to pre moistened clay for the face.. (idk about scalp)TDLR: Should I use pre moistened clay on my face as well?",5,122
967,"And did aaj even say to use pre moistened clay with ACV on the scalp?. 2:Fermented milk is good for the skin, but it is not included in the primal body care cream, or in his reccomendations for hair loss creams.. How should I add it to my routine?. Should I add an ounce to the body care cream?. Or apply it seperately?",5,63
968,"And you never said, should I apply fermented milk to my scalp (or hair)?. 3:You said you can keep clay from drying by having something moist over it, but if I have something moist over it, it will never dry.. And you said the way to know to rinse the clay off is right before it dries.. So now how am I supposed to know how long to keep the clay on my skin for?. If you want a payment or something I can help you with anything u need cause you spent a while u can dm me or something lol and you can answer it thereAnd to clarify the only specific issues I have that are outside the base protocol are :ADHD, OCD (which plays into some anxiety, and some overthinking/overanalyzing), Keratosis Pilaris Here are my questions for this:1:Use what Aajonus says in the quotes we found, which is NOT pre moistened clay.",5,155
969,But.. It should not make a difference.. 2:You put it on its own.. It works well because it is predigested so it's absorbed fast.. (then you can put more when it absorbs as much as you like).,5,37
970,"If you mix with other things it will not be as fast.. However I assume you can use fermented milk to make the body care cream as a base ingredient.. I didn't see him mention it but yes, you should be able to apply the fermented milk to your hair and get results.. Just like he swapped butter/bone marrow on the skin, the same should apply for scalp.. 3:You keep it for as long as you want, truly.",5,78
971,"There are just diminishing returns, I assume.. Just like with cheese trains it is pointless to eat 1 kilogram at once, there are only so many toxins that can be emitted at a time, having clay on for hours and hours should not have a proportional effect.. Unless you have an rea that doesn't heal, indicating it is plagued with many more toxins, then you can do what he says in the quote of the answer I gave you, which is to use it for hours.. But that's for those areas where it's the most beneficial.. So you don't hair issue, so for that it's purely prevention at this point?",5,110
972,"And that almost invisible skin issue, was it diagnoses by a doctor?. I will tell you pragmatically, you will MUCH more results from the other protocols, from the eating part.. Topically you do not need to go extreme like this, right, unless a specific problem.. A woman had a breast cancer dissolving her breast (a Swiss actress I think, I put it in the Aajonus receipts documents) and he applied a clay cheese poultice there, said it stopped the bleeding and then breast started restoring.. There is also another great helpful thing you can do for redirecting brain toxins and therefore hair, I don't know if I wrote it in the hair posts.",5,113
973,"It's oil pulling or cheese pulling.. That should do much more than putting clay on face for more than a little time.. So you can oil/cheese pull 10-20 minutes a day and that will accomplish a lot more.. For ADHD, OCD and so onWhat isn't in the base regimen, and that could be necessary: nut formula once a week (could be a bit less or a bit more).. and depending on how many activity rings, more or less hours of sports/singing and yeah man I'll accept the payment if you think it helped you What is a good olive oil brand that doesn't dilute?",5,104
974,"oliflix 1:ok, so use non-pre-moistened clay for both scalp and face mixed with acv?. 2:should i use the fermented milk on my hair or only scalp?. And how many times a week would you personally reccomend I use it?. 3:ah alright.. .",5,42
975,"im just gonna apply it and wash it off before it can dry.. so i wont need a damp cloth on top.. does that work?. Holy fuck thank you for writing that im about to read it so im probably gona do it seperate nah but i cant do it pure i gotta dilute it, he said he also dilutes it 90% in another qna.. Isnt that what you want?",5,70
976,"cause he already does that in the facial cream ok if aaj does it then do it go for it The facial cream is Coco cream, butter, marrow, cream    Honey, royal jelly, and juice it's not 100% necessary but maybe facial cream has different applications Its called body care cream not facial cream my bad Ok but we are talking about scalp right now Again, you can test it for yourself Wait where did aaj talk about coco cream for scalp chris has to be fermented Ik where did he talk abt it Also technically I dont need the clay or acv for baths as I have clean water since i use his filter formula but i still add it Whenever its cold i notice purple discoloration on my skin, my veins go away compltelely, and everything is purple and discolored @ChrisTranchita , you were kinda wrong.. he said if you use pure fermented coco cream on scalp as shampoo it will pull toxins.. Ok oh ok thanks so much .. so the total amount of water i should add us first 3 ounces to the mixture then 1 cup (8 ounces) in the waterpik right?. and how frequent should i use this mixture in the waterpik.",5,207
977,"i think he said once every 7-10 days right.. water oil can replace flossing correct?. you won't bald you need help SMH yeahhhhhhh yeahhhhh blame the detox sorry, detox 😅 I will pay you $50 per session we can have to chat and ask questions How long do we put the ACV and clay on the scalp for?. Do we use it like soap or let it sit ?. And if you do know, how much acv/clay do we use hard R?",5,82

I thought bacteria is not dangerous 🤔 Google it see it that way mercury is the worst neurotoxin, maybe even worse than botox still, mercury as a trace element, as a natural part of some foods, is said by Aajonus to be, for example, helping fish with buoyancy what can make the difference between a toxin and a nutrient is what goes along with them Ok bet 🔥 u can convert Weird question, but is using plastic earplugs bad?.

Is it okay temperature?. Like there is documents showing in c0vid vaxx ppl long stringy parasites in their blood..

So there was no baby, but the women was healing faster, so technically women can heal alot faster by just getting pregnant and giving birth, bcz the body still uses the baby to discharge toxins, it is what it is.. Better to detox than have an autistic child But yeah, if you are pregnant sheesh, I don’t even know, haven’t researched it To be fair her boyfriend was also detoxing Don't panic tho, it won't last forever obviously I see, the fact that ur pregnant might have a big role with this detox, if u actually read the books then u would know that either way, u don't just get ""sick"" from bacteria, it's all detox from toxins Unfortunately I can’t have a bath that hot I’m pregnant To me hot baths sped up the whole process and helped with everything including apetite Also hot bath might help Pain all over body and diarrhea and nausea, I had similar one just a week ago There's always an explanation for every kind of detox Everything but the cheese Need to also listen to workshops there's alot of unexplored newer information Clay?",5,380

There are groups and nobody has a problem finding each otherThe problem that come with it have been much bigger for several of usAnd you do not trade 5% of convenience for a bigger riskIt's thinking backwards Why do people think it’s absolutely necessary to do meetups just because they’re primals?.

Yes for sure I think aajonus said that to a guy who started the diet at 45 years old But he was referring to pottenger's experiments on cats right, i think it was 5 generations of cats and the human body creates all new cells over a 7 year period so thats 35 years right there.. Idk if thats the logic he was using It depends on a lot of variables definitely I don't think he gave a magic number besides that if I remember correct all in all, detox never stops its a natural process as long as we keep breathing chemtrails😉 When talking about specific diseases he would specify more That’s a long time 😅 And how should I feel when I’m fully detoxed?.

He was telling me about the tradition and how 15-18 year old boys go out in the wild with older men to be initiated and learn survival tactics ect.. For a month they live naked and don’t shower.. They are pastoral tribes like the Maasai, (interestingly they also need to pull calves sometimes as well) he was telling me how the tribes look 20 and are 50 and would live to 100+ and still be fit and strong ect.. They eat mostly raw dairy sometimes mixed with blood, (his tribe also mixes milk with charcoal) some raw organs and cooked meat on special occasions.",5,172
1260,"They also make alcohol from corn like products fermented with milk on special occasions.. He said that the issue is when the natural tribes mix with the modern people.. I asked him about the high infant mortality rate, he believes it was from mixing with modern people.. (He believed because of germ theory contagious diseases and the unnatural food), he was skeptical about the vaccines, i could tell he didn’t think they were necessary.. He just thought that people should decide on their own what to put in their body.",5,90
1261,"So i asked him if he was vaccinated and he said he got a couple shots as a baby because his mother wanted him to, he grew up in his village in nature making huts and living off of the cows and nature.. He is rather short (probably 5 foot 8-9) so i assume it could be because of the vaccines he got as a child.. And i assume this is what caused the high infant mortality rate as well.. But he said anyone in Maasai/Kalenjin tribes who lived past childhood is very healthy and lives 80+ years old with a youthful appearance and energy.. Toxins dumping can cause pain too, I'd eat cheese Suppose people probably realise they don’t need to be 100% to enjoy a healthy enjoyable life Yeah tribal men dumb dumb, they only live to 50 Who know tho, wouldn't really trust their (non) record keeping Honestly, If I didn't have a drivers license or had to deal with legal forms, there's no way I'd know my birth was almost 50 years ago Yeah because you didn’t grow up monitoring the moons phases and the seasons every day Not saying that what your saying isn’t a possibility did you feel like throwing up during the whole ordeal?",5,211

I have a knot behind my left thigh that has been there for years and prevents me from ever fully relaxing that leg so I think that is sort of pulling my body down and making it twisted.",5,93

Not that bad but yep that’s me They forgot about neck.,5,81
1274,Tight af Neck and back..

LMAO It’s not hard to fix posture Bones stop growing by 25 for men and earlier for women..

Thats not including people that already eat raw for whatever reason He mentions that it is usually caused by being too thin, which leads  the fat from the myelin in the nerves to be stripped away Yes Way too much Id say there is easily 100,000+ people who eat at least 80% raw dairy, raw meat/raw eggs, not including tribes people..

It is the most important factor for people failing on Primal Diet is they drink too little celery juice, then cant eat meat and fat come some time, and get damaged by their own toxins that the body releases from its stores and cannot remove, only celery juice (or the only other replacement aajonus confirmed, sugar cane juice) can remove those We do not have precise examples to comment but the bad outcome is from lacking the proper foods or from doing other interventionsBacteria can go anywhere there are toxins or damaged cells and start pulling them out No this is not Primal DietBoth are important and celery juice is required Yeah but sometimes the ""infection"" spread to the lymph, blood or other tissues such as bones, which usually give a bad outcome.. So why does it happen if bacteria are always good for us?. Bro you get to drink some of the highest quality french dairy & eggs but put the infasis on celery juice ?.

1332,"As the main other person who got involved in it, I can add that Erik has only proven to be a liar and a backstabber, a crazy person, and Aiden is his servile coward, but nonetheless he has confirmed what you said, and even his messages paraphrasing what you heard match with the exact quote of Erik you are giving now.. I now consider this insane problem that lasted 2 years over.. This isn't the first time Erik has tried to get me and others to believe I did something that I did not do.. He made vague public accusations towards me, accusing me of being involved in the Ring drama.. I told him several times that I had no idea what he was talking about, and that I had never spoken to Ring, but Erik insisted.",5,137
1333,"He told me I was ""now a better person"" than I had been than when I did this ""thing"".. He said all of this with such conviction that I questioned my own reality and sanity for months, and thought that maybe I had done something and forgotten about it.. I talked to many people to get to the bottom of this drama to find out what I was being accused of by Erik since he would not elaborate, but it wasn't until last summer that Rom told me that messages had been leaked from a private group about Ring to Ring..

I heard Erik say something that I paraphrased to people in a private group some weeks later.. The topic was drugs and girls.",5,96

Joe was in his usual fashion talking about Erik, and something Joe said made what Erik had said on the call pop into my head because it was of similar nature to what I had heard on the call.. Even the very first time mentioning this, I said I was not making an accusation against Erik and that what he had said was vague.",5,129

I could not find the exact time Joe posted his message, it could have been before or after I talked to Aiden, but it doesn't really matter as Joe would have posted his message anyway.. He was out of control.. After Joe had posted his message my first instinct was to write to Erik, but I talked to Matt, whom I trusted, and asked him what I should do.. He thought it was best to lay low and let dust settle, and I decided to listen to him.",5,109

Later I asked him to specify what he had said on the call so that I could make a clear post that wouldn't be misunderstood but he just told me that I had ""made it up"".. We stopped talking about it here.. Since Erik was telling me and others that I had ""made it up"" I was not able to write a public apology, as I wasn't willing to lie about what I heard, and it was necessary to mention to explain the situation.. Erik also said I ""used Joe as ammo"" against him which isn't true in the slightest and is ironic because he himself is now using Joe and others as ammo against me and Rom.",5,136

As Erik's attacks towards me became more harsh, I turned to Aiden to ask what exactly had been talked about on the call so that I could make the post to clarify the situation, but he ignored the question.. Aiden is well aware of my anguish and confusion over Erik's behaviour and my attempts to solve the situation in the best way for everyone..

How much other fat are you eating?. Where did you get that?.

1374,the physical plays a significant role but it’s only part of a much larger game.. i don't think health is subjective it’s subjective.. i used to believe in fasting and it’s benefits but after reading aajonus.. i realized i have been malnourished all my life.. so fasting makes zero sense for me as my body has been starved all its life.,5,61
1375,i find no benefit in fasting.. but if my body communicates that it doesn’t want food.. i won’t feed it.. if someone believes eating cooked meat is great and helps their reality to be healthier then more power to them.. who am i to tell them it is wrong They'll feel less or more depressed But when you are religiously eating cooked meat how do i prevent reaching toxic overload in the first place?,5,74

If you ate a lot of raw, never frozen meat and didn’t even exercise, you would put on muscle if you are in an untrained state.. When meat is consumed by itself, a majority of the protein will be utilized as a source of fuel..

It will help keep your joints lubricated, feed the connective tissue, and help to really grow muscles.. The lubrication formula consists of:2 raw eggs4 ounces of raw unsalted butter2 tablespoons of raw lemon juice2 tablespoons of unheated honeyYou put that into a jar and put it in a bowl of mildly hot water, where it makes your hand uncomfortable after about 5 seconds.",5,121

How it works is the lemon juice adjusts the utilization of the butter to make it feed what was just described, but if you consume butter without lemon, it’ll normally be prioritized in feeding organs and glands.. It is most efficiently digested by drinking ⅓ of the lube before the meat, eating the meat mixed with 1-2 ounces of butter, then 10-15 minutes after the last bite, start finishing the lube.",5,100

It's just a bit weird and funny)What about eating chicken intestines?. ""Eating vegetation causes alkalinity in the human digestive tract, which should be acid.. Between 40% and 80% of the friendly bacteria and flora are paralyzed or destroyed in an alkaline environment.. Cooking destroys nutrients, creates toxins that accumulate as carcinogens, causes the digestive tract to be over-acidic, and damages health.",5,130
1494,"Eating raw vegetables is good when on a cooked diet because vegetables neutralize some of the acidity.. However, if a person eats raw foods, including red meat, fowl and seafood, her/his digestive tract would be impaired by the consumption of whole raw vegetables because they would destroy the bacteria that makes digestion of meat and fat proper.. If you combine raw meat with raw vegetables it often impairs digestibility of both foods, unless someone suffers from over-acidic digestive tract.. I recommend that people drink their vegetables with the pulp completely removed.. That way the juice is usually absorbed near the duodenum without alkalinizing the intestines.",5,105
1495,"Also, eating more than a little fruit each day deteriorates the tissues and bones, imbalances the sugar level and causes poor mental function"" Yes that's true, but in WWTL he also said that removing all fiber can make the celery digest much faster, and any times i added leaves it added so much fibers the whole celery turned into a jello and was extremely bitter seems like there were barely any in this one yeah eating fat and maybe even grated cheese with it is typical strategy to catch toxins in the food whichever it is (whether meat or fruit or other) Pig intestines Yes, I still use them every evening and my sleep, energy, and eyesight are still benefitting.. Less headache too Hot baths What would you with non-organic celery?. What is best way to extract some of toxins out of it?. I’ve heard about baking soda mixed with water or acv Do you guys include the leaves when juicing celery?.

In general, I would say yes, and so I would not eat 100% raw foods without proper celery what about mixing an egg to it ?.

1548,"These breeds like cresteds, Yorkshire terriers, spitzs etc bring more problems to their masters than joy.. Personally i feel a lot of pity for such kind of nature mockering because dogs mostly suffer from different illnesses and die early.. The only thing you can do to prolong its desperate life is to start feeding the dog raw milk, eggs and liver.. Never give it special dog feed or any kind of medicines.. There are so many dogs in the world who look like dogs.",5,84
1549,"They may be of no specific breed but they are clever, healthy and didn't lose their instincts.. You can save a little puppy from the street and raise it instead of paying thousands in cash for degradation sponsorship.. I saw a lot of dogs on kibble who eat their own poop..

Are ovens high EMF Didn't know about this lol I had a microwave lying around not using it, threw it away thanks.. Interesting.",5,115
1590,How much does a cow cost in the US?. I suppose prices may differ according to the breed.. For example here in my country you can buy a dairy goat for 30$ and for 1500$ and even more Depends on the breed.. Baby goats are the cheepest because in order to get milk an animal must bear babies.. And there are cases when it can be infertile or bring dead babies etc That's why animals who already give milk are much more expensive.,5,83

It probably took too long to separate It's strange because without lemon I think mine almost always separates faster, and it was not a cold temperature either I would raise the temperature the temp likely fluctuated between 68 and 71..

Some people even ""illegally"" exported wagyu race DNA and started raising breeds outside of Japan.. I'll look that up Or was that Kobe beef I think they get massages too so that the meat is extra tender or something The cows have a special diet They feed to cows a diet of only grains and a ton of beer to make the meat as fatty as possible I believe it is made specifically to top certain Japanese dishes in small portions like in Ramen noodles, but 'animal based' people are cooking huge steaks of the stuff What kind of craze is there?",5,159
1617,") Sorry I don't understand what you're asking Has anyone else noticed the craze around Wagyu beef?. Yes, fat trimmings are even better as a fat source.. Can you replace butter with it?. any fats Compared to other fats like butter?. It's harder to digest if you mix a lot of fat with the meat In the pate guide why doesn’t it say to mix the fat and meat at the end?",5,72
1618,"Specifically for fermenting?. @leclayrom More bacteria for me Imagine being comfortable with that freak’s fingers all over your food I would like to meet others if possible Isn’t it about the taste of the meat not the fat It is extremely fatty which makes it ""melt like butter"".. It's permeated with fat everywhere.. Famously the cooking channels that talk about it often say that they only cook it without adding any fat, because it already has so much fat.. Around wagyu Mm right like marbled I live in England and the people here really have the worst attitude towards food that I can think of aside from other English speaking countries As far as i know the best wagyu cows are fed their mothers' milk up to 6 months old.",5,130
1619,Then thery are pasture raised and only then they are fed grains.. Those grains are definitely of different quality comparing to gmo corn and soy.. I believe wagyu are fed wheat and barley.. Probably there are different kinds (or levels of quality) in that sphere.. So yeah there's no demand for a good butcher Oh those people.,5,57
1620,".. .. Exactly, before they shutdown I asked another butcher about the plastic wraps Cling film/Serran Wrap on all the meat he sells.. He told me that people didn't want to buy meat if it wasn't wrapped in plastic.. .",5,40

1623,"Please come and get it.. The best quality my dear.. Bye.. I have to drive an hour to a nice family farm for my meat and raw milk Actually everything is wrapped in plastic Where I live there used to be about 5 butcher shops, they have closed down over the years and now there's only one left.. They sell mostly pastries, sausages and bacon.",5,65
1624,And frozen liver that is vacuum packed in plastic 😂 They'll never figure it out Such a pity.. .. .. But they more likely closed because of drop in demand for their meats right.. People nowadays go and buy any piece of shit in the supermarket but not from a farmer.,5,51

Even in carnivore diet circles they are highly debating between grass-fed and grain-fed, a lot of them haven't figured it out Yes you are absolutely correct I'm so glad primal diet exists because the mainstream options are Processed Food/ vegan/vegetarian / or meat based morons promoting unethical nutritionally deficient and factory farmed meat In order for animals to have a lot of good grass corporations must stop growing crops.. I hate to see this kind of farming, let them eat grass.. I heard that the Matsusaka beef is considered by some to be even more high-end, but it's less known.",5,102
1626,"A cow won't get enough fat if it's pulled off mother's milk too early) I suppose there are different farmers even in Japan doing it differently.. Someone takes care of the animals and follows tradition of growing wagyu.. Someone on the other hand force feed the cows in order to get quick money.. Yes definitely, I have been thinking that a lot.. Seems like there are parallels with the ""foie gras"", the goose liver that is force-fed grains to have a very fatty liver.",5,84

This is a major event that could decide on whether many farms in the USA are going to be able to keep selling raw milk in states that forbid it, and to sell fresh, non-frozen, non-chemically treated, raw meat.. For those who don't know, Miller's Organic Farm is a massive operation that supplies high quality raw animal foods throughout the USA.. Aajonus worked with them for a long time and a lot of PDers (as well as non-PDers as well) rely on him, such as for his raw unsalted cheese, grass-fed non medicated meat, etc.. (although he is not the only source of raw unsalted cheese in the cheese, but the main one).",5,116
1639,"Aajonus set up the private membership there so that Amos could sell these raw animal products legally, even where raw milk is illegal.. That's the principle of private membership: it doesn't go through commercial law and thus the FDA (agency that regulates foods) has no jurisdiction over it.. That worked well for a long time, even after Aajonus' death, but the farm has been under attack by the authorities in recent times.. There was a first trial months ago where they had to pay a huge fine ($200k or more).. Recently they confiscated all the foods, and a new trial took place today.",5,103

But the point is ; is eating lemon with beef recommended?,5,117

It's cynara cardunculus its like a similar species I think to the milk thistle and they both also have similar benefits Have you tried to make a rennet with them?",5,101
1672,I wonder if it's possible without boiling the flowers to make decoction.. I think that would be possible Milk thistle has amazing benefits for the liver and its function apparently I was just now looking at it today and no I haven't thought of doing that People have used it to aid fatty liver So for example how can we use that in cheesemaking.. Just leave fresh flowers covered with water to soak for a couple if days and then use this liquid?. I think smth like this.. We have these flowers in july here) i will try once again this year.,5,102
1673,Also i found an interesting article about thistle cheese but there's no recepie of the rennet unfortunately.. For goat cheese thistle rennet is good..

Dairy products can take short term (<24h) freezing better than meat so it might not have suffered a lot of nutrient loss yet.",5,83
1678,I would just defrost it Thanks Sara!. ~8-10 pieces) Is high meat the best for dissolving scar tissue?. just got back into cheese making from a few years ago.. I had a system/rhythm that worked then but everything I have now is different.. I think you are correct about the lid.,5,51
1679,It reminds me of making sour dough.. It didn't really get going till my kitchen was properly inoculated after a few cycle of making it.. I held temp a 80-85F for that culture.. I was just following an old cheese making instruction I got from aajonus q and a about using lemon to accelerate separation.. I think my lid caused it to take long it smelled like some herb.,5,69
1680,My jar/lid was borrowed from a friend.. My latest batch separated a bit faster.. It is my understanding that the cheese flavor is partially imported by the type of bacteria/microbes which temperature selects for so I was looking into holding the temp a bit higher to get a different flavor.. In the past I had better flavor with faster separation also.. I usually use honey  to make kefer for better end flavor.,5,72
1681,Recently it separated into curd and whey when I left ti a bit too long (55hrs) it made a sort of cream cheese after hanging overnight which  was a nice flavor.. I may tweak this to make a hard cheese.. Different honeys do behave differently in my kefers.. I don’t know if it’s the best but it’s one of the things that can.. Probably depends on where the scar tissue is When will you start filming highmeatexperiment?,5,77
1682,"😇 Oh Sara🤭 yeah that was in plans but I am still feeling too shy for that😂😂😂Need some rehearsal.. Especially if you have detoxes with half aching head and a twitching eye😭🤣 Just curious, why the hurry to separate whey and curd?. I just put milk in a jar and let it sit for 2 days.. It took longer before, but I reuse the jar, and now it only takes two days.. I don't heat mine at all, and even when' it's very cold, at most it takes 3 days to seperate.",5,92

1685,"That is: you feel like crying from pain but you can't because everything makes you smile😂 Should have more celery now.. Failed to make enough juice.. Thoughts about cleaning the kitchen after juicing always causes pain too😂 It's on average a maximum of one tablespoon a day, so it's not much, and with some dairy cream along with it, it should balance.. Anyone taken Royal jelly Okay thanks 👍 Can we drink any kind of liquid (Like water) while eating, because sometimes my throat becomes very dry while eating only and not drinking drink moisturising formula with your meat You can have a little bit of milk (no more than half a cup, the less the better) Or just have lube formula Not water?.

1690,I was.. That's why i still have those brain detoxes.. Like headaches and brain fog etc.. Interesting It's when you keep dry cheese in your mouth near the gums in order to absorb toxins from brain iirc What’s cheese pulling?. Does anyone do cheese pulling?,5,45
1691,It's so inconvenient to fall asleep with cheese😂Can we do it during the day time?. If yes for how long?. @leclayrom What does lymph detox feel like for you?. Read the lore Is there anyone here from Czechia?. 🇨🇿 Interesting.,5,40
1692,"I was eating a ton of them at the hot springs and noticed i would slip into lymph detox faster with grapefruit in my bloodstream.. I wonder if it has any effect on lymph, or if i was just mistaking low blood pressure for detox effects.. Anyone who knows where to buy Pannerone (cheese) in Milan?.

1693,"Aajonus Vonderplanitz the Healer pretty cool so we could call him a Healer he would say heal and not cure, because that term has legal binding Better sleep with cheese than die from a heart attack🙈🤭😂 Who’s Owanza?. insane Aajonus' client, who had 11 tumors I think, then his girlfriend and they worked together.. Her name is in the book, she came up with some remedies I just read your message and went to eat high eggs second time in my life..

Much more effective than I expected because at the end of the week I went into a big head detox too, so putting coconut cream only on the skin can trigger a reaction.. Starting to understand why Aajonus used it as 'soap' to wash his whole body Should be Yeah 63 i got them quite a lot Is it ok to eat raw meat that stayed at room temperature, but within a vacuum packaging, for several hours?. how do you notice this I know it doesn't answer your question but you could do oil pulling as well - I have done it during the day whilst working.. Fantastique😁 what it would taste like I wonder how it would be if I mix cream + high eggs + honey Chewy yolk is yummy I read my message and went to eat some more high liver😂😂 She had more like 60 tumors I think He had a honorary PhD but that's not a medical doctor Can do it anytime Was aajonus a doctor?",5,219
1695,"So cheesecake will help since cheese and honey.. He wont eat cheese and honey aloneeWhat about lube formula is that good?. The following is not medical adviceAny amount of raw will help according to AajonusProbably the easiest for a person is to get raw unsalted cheese, with unheated honey, since it appears similar Dad is 65, getting tons of XRAY and MRI to see if his heart disease will make it bad for him to get knee replacement surgeryHis knee is pretty bad from years of playing soccer and running, its considered ""bone on bone"" and cartiliage is displaced..

Does that change people’s taste for cooked foods and other addictions or is that bullshit?. Have you tried Aajonus’ throat lozenge?. im honestly surprised i was expecting u to say either the creme fraische or the coco cream since it ""lubricates"" since when can you reply to specific parts of msgs wtf The more cheese and honey he eats the more it can rebuild stuff Alright I just write this as a disclaimer because I'm not a doctor, classic.. what is medical advice?",5,111

He also said it can be used to marinate fish That Owanza was allergic to every food even water besides freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, yeah Yer pretty good What are the uses for grapefruit?",5,98
1699,"I never found much in the books but vaguely recall something from the talks and Owanza being nuts about em Aajonus would say to wean off themif there is high blood pressure it's to push through congestion according to aajonuscertain foods which act as solvent can help with it, like vinegar or unripe pineapple.. best to eat them with fat.. so if you make something like a sort of sauce with raw butter and a bit of vinegar inside, or a drink with some raw cream and some unripe pineapple, it can blast through stuffraw garlic can regulate blood pressure up or down depending on body needshalf a grapefruit can also, but there are compatibility problems with some heart medication so be careful How many moldy raspberries did aaj say to eat at one time?. Is it 3 berries once a week?. Also, he is on blood thinners because he has some sort of heart issue, if I were to tell him to stop taking blood thinners would I need to replace it with anything more ""natural""?",5,177

1704,"The stuff I bought in Arizona and NewMex wouldn’t clabber.. It would ferment in an odd way too.. I suspect “raw” is a label that just means *minimally pasteurized* OR they’re washing the insides of the containers with something weird, effecting the bacteria in the milk.. Pale colour in my shit = overly alkaline right?. Thoughts?",5,56

I'll try more later 🤪 Gag reflex and wanted to puke while eating it so I stopped Couldn't swallow more than like 2 oz I prepared some high liver Not too surprising if you drank it quite quickly, sounds like you had pain where the liver is?",5,104

Yeah most likely detox and cheese will be helpful, unless you have a special condition like Crohns..

I mean, it's sound obvious that it's better if a wound doesn't become infected So how is this a good thing?. And when they become infected they don't heal as fast But not all wounds become infected Yeah but there are damaged cells in every wounds that are recycling damaged/dead cells It is because of bacteria Did Aajonus explained why some wounds become infected, if it's not because of bacteria?. Do you chew it up and just have bits by your gums?",5,109
1711,"It's not uncomfortable?. you’re welcome 🙏🏻 Fair, noted Here we eat raw foods.. That’s the whole point of a group, more precisely it’s about Aajonus Vonderplanitz’s Primal Diet.. And your question kind of leads to conclusion that you don’t understand where you are, asking about cooking which we don’t do in the traditional sense.. If you’re asking about testicles’s combinations with other raw foods, then it’s reasonable to use better word alternatives to meticulously convey your thought I'll exhort you to get busy in any way you can if you don't have any fruitful to come up with What does that even suppose to mean?",5,105
1712,"Bro do you know where you are?. Hi I had previously asked the right way to cook beef testicles would someone be kind enough to share recipe does it moisturise the skin?. Both do the same The dry cheese thing is something else Cheese pulling is when you chew cheese and swish it around your mouth like coconut oil pulling No?. yeah Not really I need to use animal fat on my skin too so I alternate between the coconut cream and bone marrow, butter, or primal face cream.. It might be that there are more toxins there that need to come out If I store milk in my fridge for longer time it will just ferment slower but should still be fully enjoyable right?",5,125

Raw unsalted cheese You have some cheese with honey and you're setits good to eat a lot of fat and that allows to keep up the need for minerals for it note: butter does this even more Yeah.",5,77
1717,Its all about balance.. Milk is such a magical substance Luckily nature combined milk which has a lot of minerals with cream 🫶🏻 More food for thought Important point here: avocado and coconut cream do not protect the body.. They cause detox.. We need raw animal based fat otherwise clay milk to bind to the toxins there is one exception to thisaajonus actually said that some Asian people who eat coconut cream since they are young can use it as building blocks.. coconut cream is mostly saturated fat I think so it could play a role.,5,96

Its confusing because WAPF doesn't recommend juices at all but that's probably only because they didn't see it in the tribes that Price had studied I'm guessing..

Usually if somebody has leaky gut, they don't produce mucus that protects the mucus lining.. So their own digestive acids and digestive bacteria eat away at the intestinal wall which becomes thinner and thinner and then, when you even have a small amount of food that collects in an area, it will tear.",5,139

Just one example but keto experts will tell you to not eat more than two fists of meat a day, and that meat is often overcooked Hydration formula, or pretty much anything primal is hydrating That’s great thanks So it has nothing to do with weight loss oxidation of triglycerides sounds like it has to do with how the body produces energy from fat i guess, synthetic, idk what can be synthetic about it ok but that's not from aajonus Yes but I wanna know the meaning of synthetic oxidation of triglycerides weight loss = eating 1 raw egg at a time, spaced by like 2 hours, drinking celery juice, not much milk, and that's it (not medical advice) What is the process It doesn't help you, Aajonus explains the mechanisms behind weight loss Hmmm, probably better to ask a medical “professional” about these things Will it help with weight loss and what’s the meaning of it It’s not a food I think Put* But can someone explain what that is I don’t think it’s a food ?",5,247

It's not, it's a chemical process This is out of the scope of aajonus teachings because you can't eat that it's like if you ask if breathing has to do with weight loss Its irrelevant you have to consider that I'd you grew your own celery it would be more nutrient rich and you would only need half or 1/4th of juice even.. so we kinda have to drink a bit faster to have enough juice, it's not a big deal, as long as you don't drink it super fast, getting the appropriate amount is the priority even if all water from it is not 100% absorbed @leclayrom so the primal guide's routine says 2-4 cups of juice in the morning..

LDL is a lipid, triglyceride is different it's fine to go faster LDL isn't a triglyceride, I think.. Yes the reaction it seems can be done through free radicals.",5,87
1880,"What an idiot lol No She's right about it being excretory, but of course we can absorb things through it as well.. I see, thanks!. Sounds like it's officially the first stage of digestion where a lipid chemically loses an electron via some reaction, which means it breaks down or converts to energy.. Since this is to do with fat, it also is linked to weight loss because you would either be converting fat to energy or breaking it down, both times reducing the amount of fat and therefore weight in the body..

So the protective layer on the outside of the egg called the ""bloom"" has been washed off.",5,96

1988,Looks great Circa 2005 from when it looks much like him Yes Goats milk or sheep milk generally has more fat than cows milk but less cream for making butter and cheese..

1989,can’t find a butter or cream source where i live.. Not a good idea unfortunately.. To use a separator you'll have to either heat milk up to 40-41'c or pour it straight from the udder..

I supplemented with both cows and goats milk.,5,85
1993,"Yes the general rule is if you can put you hand in the water for 5 sec that water is ok to submerse a jar in to heat up the contents of that jar without damaging the nutrients Keep in mind some bacteria may survive or even thrive at higher temperatures but the other nutrients like minerals and vitamins start to break down at about that temp, so you have to weigh the benefit of targeting a certain bacteria vs the loss of other nutrients.. And it is not just the loss of those nutrients, but the harm the can cause if they become too toxic.. Example: minerals that turn to cauterized sharp rocklike substances when heated.. thanks.. i’m just trying to isolate certain bacteria’s and yeast because i react poorly to those that thrive in lower temperatures.",5,138
1994,probably had to do with histamine.. so i can confidently submerge the jar sealed without any fear?. i don’t need it to breathe to ferment properly correct?. i forgot to use my own saliva and i didn’t put any honey in it.. just plan raw goat milk.,5,47
1995,he is has some got takes tho but he is crazy 40 and an hypocrite Just celery juice alone?. with carrots.. good proportions also tried cabbage juice was wonderful fit my stomach but problematic for my joints aswell i can’t win The army fucked me up .. got a h.. pylori infection which led to ulcers and i couldn’t swallow food.,5,61
1996,"was given hard antibiotics and developed gastritis as a result.. was also given pills to lower stomach acid.. not to mention was on SSRIs at age 17 and during that time.. can you imagine…so a lot of my stomach issues and food intolerances developed since then and got worse and worse.. in addition to crohns, according to the dumb tests i have lactose and fructose malabsorption which from your/my pov is probably a gut dysbiosis and absence of bacteria that help digest them, or an abundance of bacteria that promote gas.",5,91

1999,"for* every time i eat this particular food i develop debilitating joint pain, rigidity, weakness.. it’s terrible.. He eats no raw foods anymore, a lot of cooked grains & sugar, little meat & animals foods in general.. He even had plastic eye surgery “He threw out the child with the bath water”.. That’s a saying here 😅 This is what happens when you overcomplicate things and with a reputation like franks it only exasperated his ego and drive to try find a magical concoction of unnatural doses of nutrients to fix health issues And how exactly did you know the issue was with clearing oxalates To blame something.",5,108
2000,.. and not take full responsibility.. .. 😬 that sounds indeed like a total mess.. .,5,16
2001,"All this research basically made him obsessed with it and it ended up making him believe that his issues were caused by too much iron from a meat based diet it’s mandatory where i’m from Just a total mess He got too far into the so called benefits of each nutrient and started taking supplements and basically thinking that illnesses are caused and can be treated by talking isolated nutrients and an excess of particular nutrients.. Then he realised this would imbalance so he researched more to find how he could balance it What happened with frank tufano?. I know, going slow is really hard, especially as an all or nothing person, but with every try we learn 😅 the hard way sometimes but yeah.. .. Battling different health issues can be quite a challenge, but I believe they are all connected to the same root cause(s).",5,147
2002,"Eat as much fat as you can to hydrate your skin, hydration comes from inside out.. Aajonus said to get your body strong firstly, if you don’t have any urgency, and only then start to detox..

I rather go slow than suffering some consequences of going all in.",5,80

2004,the celery wrecked me.. why?. cause i have issues with clearing oxalates.. not gonna tell myself its detox when it’s clearly not.. can’t be hard headed when you have so many chronic illnesses.,5,33
2005,gotta incorporate what you have learned in addition to what Aajonus preaches.. our starting point differs a lot.. we didn’t start the journey from an early age and the effects are present.. gotta be able to adjust and once you feel you reached that equilibrium then I believe you can try the stuff that were problematic.. It’s kind of sad.,5,60
2006,.. Perhaps he didn’t consume enough fats and high meat for his brain/neurological health 😏 Where is it?. Don’t mind answering Washington.. Weird their site says its very expensive to ship.. Do they have butter?,5,35
2007,@itrollallcapsbr I emailed Frankie's Meats to get the cheese temperature but no reply yet.. Does he ever reply?. Inevitably you will be going 2 opposite directions which are not synergistic I'm not really a good person to ask because I am  in Pennsylvania where all the farms are located I'm going through a detox right now and since yesterday ONLY my upper lip feels dry and is cracking open a tiny bit.. I also have been feeling a burning sensation.. Is this perhaps me detoxing through my lips?,5,88
2008,"Didn't think that was possible.. .. 200ml of carrot juice means you need 1000ml of celery mixed with that to make it a 20% carrot, 80% celery juice like Aajonus recommends Yeah That's incorrect according to Aajonus you become orange because of beta carotene.. your body can’t process it into vitamin A Right so I guess just a total of 200ml with the celery should be fine Because it's good.. I have it with some milk because aaj mentioned that woman who cured her cancers with that but then I read that the same woman was messed up from all the carrot juice Yeah it'll make you orange from the bile coming out but too much of it will mean it starts the production of too much bile Based on what he's said about it you should be having it with celery always and usually no more than 20%-30% of the juice being carrot Why are you drinking carrot juice by itself?",5,162

They have butter and cheese And if you accept the idea of low igg causing allergies, then you will accept more germ theory nonsense What’s the deal with oxalates i tried going blind and ignoring everything i know.. not again Rash?. itching Do you get a bad reaction to milk Thank you 🙌🏼 its a histamine forming bacteria .",5,71
2013,it takes histidine and turns it into histamine Why do you want to kill Bulgaricus👀😳 maybe if i buy the strain in a powder form then mix it in with the milk before the fermentation?. that way it’s going to dominate… just a thought so i put raw goats milk in a vacuum sealed jar in asia’s vide bath of 40 degrees celsius.. it came out like cottage cheese so it separated in 24 hours.. it’s slightly bitter but not too much.. it’s potent.,5,84
2014,i’ll try less time on my next batch.. i’m trying to isolate a strain called gg rhomanosus which should help with histamine.. but i’mnot sure it’s possible because there are other anaerobic strains that cause issues like Bulgaricus who thrive at similar temps and conditions.. anyone had a clue?. High eggs are full of bacteria which feed our colon and prevent us from becoming schizo.,5,65
2015,.. .. .. or other mental issues.. There are severely neglected cases appearing around you know.,5,16
2016,.. .. very severe.. .. .,5,6
2017,They must teach us important things.. We should eat much bacteria.. It's in the book Benefits of Raw cheese and eggs.. Aajonus tells us about century eggs.. You can have a look here.,5,33
2018,"Hey, what benefits from eating 8 months old eggs?. These eggs are soo stinky🙈😭🤣 Don't follow my example if you aren't prepared🤭😅That's just traditional countryside breakfast from time to time.. Moldy (8 months) blueberries.. High (stinky 8 months) eggas.. Goat milk.",5,41

2020,igsh=amZtbXR0cmUyZzlm I tried blood once and I mixed it with goat milk.. Didn't really notice anything and it wasn't particularly appealing to me Damn that sucks immensely.. I'll email them though to see what they say.. I was so excited when I saw it haha.. I was like YES I finally get to try some.,5,55
2021,But I guess not It's probably frozen so it's useless Yo Has Aajonus said anything about drinking animal blood?. Frankie selling some Thank you!. Congratulations!. I'm happy for u.. What a relief!,5,32
2022,"I remembered ur message in here and randomly remembered and worried how that turned out ☺️ Yes he’s perfect 💘 Ik WAP says goat milk o think too R u the one who got sick from oysters?. Ur baby came out good?. But the issue is you start talking about you have problems with kefir and then you think its caused by a certain bacteria, which could be the case, but again thats not the root cause of your issues.. Aajonus’s ideas are simple, once you start complicating things you will end up like frank tufano nope.. i have seborrhea dermatitis.",5,101
2023,i react to certain things.. so yogurt is a big trigger for example.. .. get flaky skin.. i’m trying to populate my gut with bacteria that can help in that regard and also support my helminths.,5,36
2024,probiotics that are histamine producing cause issues like in cultured yogurts and the likes.. I have Crohns https://www.. instagram.. com/p/Ckf9JrPOo_i/?. igsh=MWltcXViaHpyZHl4NA== It's too bad he started primal at age 57 Aajonus ideas* I wonder who this is i’m not saying it is.,5,42
2025,"you asked me about allergies in general.. my issues with food are holistic.. it can be gut dysbiosis, stomach ph, stress , etc.. unlike you though, i’m incorporating both sashimi’s ideas and the medical institution to a degree.. it’s not black and white.",5,43
2026,"has little to do with germ theory.. Don’t be fooled by all these deficiencies of chemicals that the doctor/medical institution blames your symptoms on.. There is an underlying root cause you are missing here Thats not the cause of your food sensitivities Germ theory nonsense i’m more of course i do.. i have low igg which means immmourr susceptible to allergens, pathogens hot tub really helps me.. .",5,68
2027,and i’m so dried out just using the shower here yeah i know.. i’m so terrible at slow though.. congrats on the remission.. i have numerous health issues that make my life really hard.. i recently moved from the city to a more quiet suburban place.,5,46
2028,"major fifference in fight or flight response.. i have issues with glutathione so stress builds up, hydrogen peroxide, ROS and that leads to inflammation.. my issues now with my habitat is that the water quality is shit and i have no bathtub.. i don’t know what to do, UC is in remission for 6 years though Go slow with the kefir, like really slow, start with a drop and slowly build up to a teaspoon and so on.. I get what you mean with histamine by my own experience 😏 I have a long history of ulcerative colitis, we have to go slow and at the same time work on handling stress and anxiety/trauma/fight-flight mode as well.",5,117
2029,raw with my own disgusting saliva Would you say you have allergies?. i mean the fermentation is the problem because it introduces strains my body has difficulties handling with.. raw milk unfermented induces much lesser negative effects than pure kefir.. kefir elevates my mood but i get instant itchiness and flakiness That's over halfway through Aajonus' 40 year notion Kefir as in made from kefir grains/pasteurised or raw kefir made with your own saliva?. The new body after 40 years stuff is probably irrelevant for most people unless they start the diet young because your body still gets older.,5,99
2030,"Otherwise we would live forever Lol any suicidal people up in here?. 😂 The statins fucked him up Make raw kefir You can rebuild tissue, aajonus says the healthy raw tribes he seen died at 150 in there sleep and they looked 40 Just eat some cow shit, biochemically impossible to feel suicidal my man that’s what i’m doing.. lol Keep us updated on how that goes Jeez Yes Aztec.. I'm not sure if it's a primal approved clay, but I'm less picky about what I put on my skin versus what I eat.. You can ask around for a primal approved clay anybody has a clue why my raw goat milk started to taste slightly bitter on day 3 ?",5,121
2031,"kept in fridge.. goats are pasture raised but it’s a new source Thanks Chu kok It gets bottled there, and it’s not open to the public.. .. same for Spa, which is next to Stoumont (Bru) 🤷🏻‍♀️ I had water fresh from the spring in Spain though, and really loved it!. It feels more alive 😀 it was really sweet a day ago Nice have you ever tried it?",5,69
2032,"In my experience fresh raw spring water can be a very fulfilling experience and give feelings of euphoria He recommended just gerolsteiner right We have such a spring in Belgium, Bru has natural sparkling water.. I thought AV also recommended SanPellegrino, but now for some reason they add extra carbonation unfortunately 😏 You have to run 2 seperate pipes one for the water and one for the gas So these ones he recommended like gerolsteiner these are all ones that come from springs that naturally give carbonated water I take it?. I've looked around never came across such a spring in Ontario That’s the only one afaik that doesn’t add anything to the water to sterilise it bc it has natural hydrogen peroxide that acts as an antibiotic - for us it has a little effect.. But he recommended other brands that were naturally carbonated and can be used.. Av says that when the milk starts to turn the first strain that turns causes the milk to be bitter which then sours as the process continues Exactly, thats why aajonus only recommended specific brands Eat cow shit That sounds bizarre would be cool to see a video of someone doing it thought it would just come out as carbonated Sounds like it's starting to sour such a crazy price that i’m actually contemplating getting a milk separator and buying tons of milk if possible to make cream and butter.",5,239
2033,but perhaps it’s too much work and not worth the hassle and i’ll be left with skimmed milk.. i can prepare cheese with it but I never tried.. k Is that not the case fr most sparkling water anyway I thought that was for ingesting clay That's too bad but happy you had a chance to experience that feeling.. I need to make another run to harvest some water some time For applying to your face?. No Goals bummer man.,5,80
2034,"i get mine for 7 dollars a gallon Yeah there's a couple factors to it.. I haven't had a good local source since the coop closed.. They used the  Amos family farm up in PA, which arrived frozen or close to it.. The local guy has it but at $20 a gallon and the bitterness it hasn't been a buy in a bit.. His though is just left sitting out in an open cooler when I see him and is only the middle man.",5,84
2035,pretty early compared to my last source which took a wee i wish i had fatter milk though.. i’ll keep looking for more sources.. this one is just a 15 min drive .. different goat breeds thiugh.. last one was alpine and this one is a mix of sorts.,5,49
2036,May have been kept cold enough in the tank vs the new source Raw milk when my local co-op was up would last me 1-2 weeks at a low fridge temperature.. The newer source gets his product well before the weekend market and tastes bitter pretty fast last source had a huge metallic tank that he gave me his milk from.. his herd was much bigger.. came in the morning and he told me just milked them.. .,5,78
2037,it was from the pitcher.. Do you know when the goat was milked?. You may have been getting fresher milk from the last source and it was freshly squeezed hmm interesting.. i do take his word that it was indeed milked in the morning of the same day.. That would be artificial carbonation which is detrimental Add coconut cream to my lymph baths What kind of clay did u used?,5,70
2038,"Aztec clay or what?. keep the jar 1/2 full and the water obviously covering the kefir, but not the jar so you don’t get water leaking in lol.. i also put like a small weight in it to keep it the most steady but it’s not really necessary.. yes.. i keep the jar submerged 3/4 in tightly closed or not depending on what type of organism you want .",5,69
2039,.. if you want more aerobic then you can keep it slightly open.. .. since i want the anaerobic species to dominate i kept it tightly closed.. so i put it inside a sous vide tank that is big enough.,5,40
2040,"You heat the water using a sous vide stick which keeps the water at your desired temp for however long you want.. you can set it.. That’s it basically Interesting!. So you keep the jars in warm water the whole time?. And if you did, how did you manage to keep a steady temperature?",5,54
2041,i finished making my raw milk kefir at 42 degrees c.. it took 16 hours and probably 2 hour too long as it separated too much.. the taste is different.. no sourness or bitterness.. hard to describe.,5,37
2042,".. probably has to do b with the specific organism at those temps.. the effects are immediately grounding and focusing.. Not energetic, hyper, or happy.. it’s like boom.",5,28
2043,you are here.. brain fog gone.. when i used to make kefir with grains it revved me up.. .. made me happy and hyper.,5,24
2044,probably the bacteria and the alcohol.. raw milk without grains at room temp were similar but less less so.. it’s really interesting.. i didn’t notice immediate itching after a spoonful so i’ll keep an eye on that.. for those that are interested that idea came to me after watching Aajonus talk about putting his milk kefir jars in a warm batch to promote that specific strain.,5,66

2052,because of my troath all food tasted bad but it was because i was not eating at all i had stomach pain too like 3 days How long did it last if u remember Is it normal to lose almost all appetite days after sickness really sick i did have that back when i used to get sick yes Getting concerned my appetite won’t come back I’m eating almost nothing Just normal diet.. Cheese and bath I was really sick.. But it only lasted two days and now it’s just very small stomach pain Actually I didn't really have much veg juice but maybe I would heal faster with it Their cheese is shipped with ice packs?.

What’s your take on pure nicotine?. e.. g nicotine pouches (even if they aren’t optimal since additives in there) Healthfully cheese, lecheria But I am not as read as in google pictures In pottenger's experiment it's even worse than pasteurized milk What do you think?. If trichinosis is as helpful for IBD/IBS as AV says in one of his videos, and “science” warns us for raw pork consumption because it can be infected with the parasite trichinella and therefore we can get the “disease” trichinosis, my guess is that raw (free range) organic pork is actually really good for us people with IBD.",5,110
2056,Don't forget to air it and it will be more potent.. But may cause stronger detox as well the longer you keep it.. Does high meat become more healing after a few months?. Like 5 months?. I've only ever eaten it a month and a half old That's not suitable for primal diet.,5,53
2057,Any separator needs milk heating Yes.. Funny thing is that I haven’t eaten pork in 32 years 😄 well it’s manuel :) High chicken and high fish are different in taste compared to high liver.. You have to get used to that taste.. Also depends on the kind of fish you use and how long you keep it.. Personally i find 5-7 days fish like tuna and pink salmon terribly good.,5,71
2058,Longer it becomes too slimy and smells worse.. High muscle meat is only good in páte style.. Imo.. The recepie can be found in this chat.. Pateed aged meat has a salami taste.,5,33

Does lemon juice ever go bad ?. yes, glass is preferred not sure how it evolves over time, it could get less potent matters less when it's raw And not at all for cheese trains, only when eaten with honey.. I personally don’t care whether it’s a1 or a2.",5,132

2079,".. eating lots of cereals to detox his liver 😳 and the amount of supplements… I actually feel sorry for him, there’s definitely something mentally/emotionally going on.. Did Aajonus speak about possible cause of cracks on the hands such as this?. Skin is the major detox organ so all kinds of skin issues are to be expected.. Looks like extreme lack of fat Is this person taking baths, showering, going to sauna?",5,72
2080,"Showering yes, but no bath and no sauna.. How do you know you are experiencing demineralization?. Yeah it's a liquid soap.. It's traditionally made with only olive oil tho.. is this a hematoma?",5,33
2081,"can I eat this dark spot?. How do we make kefir with raw milk?. Easing and regulating the menstrual cycle.. If it's on a raw food, don't think too hard.. The problem with the medical system (and supplements and cooking) is that it isolates things that were never meant to be isolated, and then mutates them with heat.",5,58
2082,"So if it's raw cheese, just enjoy it.. Is it possible to make it foamy like he recommended for coconut cream soap?. 1, 2 or 3?. What kind of chicken do you ask about?. Does cheese absorb toxins from the brain?",5,41
2083,"What are the benefits of raw mushrooms?. Let it sit out in room temp inside of a dark cupboard for a couple days Where is the best place to get raw cheese online Idk If you do cheese pulling Would recommend reading the egg and cheese book @leclayrom the chatbot hasn’t been working for me Guys, any advice on dealing with a hay allergy?. Use crushed up egg shells or Castile soap or acv in water.. Soak 10 min.. Rinse well.",5,81
2084,"Gotta remove pesticides.. These days organic foods also have nasty things on them.. Even water is low-key toxic.. So yeah I'd wash everything So if that was all I could find, I would go for it over the palm oil garbage sold everywhere.. And eggs That's just keeping cheese in your mouth or on your gums for a bit right?",5,60
2085,What do you use to wash vegetables?. I just bought a lot of cherry tomatoes to stay hydrated at work I would avoid it as well.. It's a very cheap oil and I believe high in PUFAs but you have to remember that it's going to be rinsed off.. You are not going to consume it.. So there's a lot worse things to clean with.,5,65
2086,"And it's better environmentally than palm oil.. Quote from QnA's specifically Nov 6 2006Q: Did you hear that on the report that came out that male sperm reduces breast cancer after 10 years of use and twice a week?. A: Well, that's why women should swallow it.. I don’t think its the same exact hormones that are in utter milk though Raw chicken is best euphoria for me U could try vinegar or Castile soap, it's less toxic It does go bad so you need fresh stuff Where do you recommend to get it?. I save lemon peels, leave them to soak in water for some days, strain, and put that liquid in a spray bottle and use for dishes etc That's up to you, just make sure you read the ingredients.",5,132
2087,There is one on Amazon that doesn't have disgusting palm oil in it which is what I would recommend.. A lot of them have palm oil (disgusting).. I have a ton of lemon peels in my freezer.. I was going to put them in vinegar.. Anyone here from Perth?,5,49
2088,"Is the penicillin that grows on cheese like camembert as bad as the medication?. Not bad) If the cheese is raw I know the meds are sterilized but wouldn't the raw stuff still grow in the body?. Even the famous Dr Bronners has palm oil so no, I don't recommend that brand but it is the easiest to find.. 🙄 I finally found a farm that is willing to sell raw milk, but they refuse to keep at room temperature for me, insists on refrigerated like around 7 Celsius before I pick up Does this destroy the milk and is it still good to drink?. It is still good to drink.",5,111
2089,You should drink It Up to 10°C.. 7 is okay.. It will lose some growth hormone though but 7 is acceptable for dairy.. I havent noted any difference.. First 2 years drinked without refreigerating ItThen 3.,5,36

I found a place to get raw cream, but they tell me it only lasts for 4 days ( Is It true?. ), and I cannot go there every week because it is very far away and inconvenient.. Anyway, I wanted to share my experience from the last time.",5,82
2092,"I still had a fever, fatigue, and weakness for about 5 days.. My body was very stressed, and I was very tired, but mentally I was more lucid than ever.. This is already the 3rd time it has happened to me in the span of 2 months.. The symptoms have been fever, gum inflammation, sores in my mouth, headache, earache, and a cold that made me produce a lot of mucus, especially this last time.. Is this a detoxification from the brain?",5,82
2093,"I would like to understand this mechanism properly and especially whether my health is improving or not due to all of this.. You can store cream for months, it just turns into sour cream.. If it’s fermented right, it has this nice mild cheesy flavor to it.. Perfect, then I will take enough for the whole month in the right quantities.. By the way, the milkshake is much better with the cream, so I will get it and store it in the refrigerator?",5,83
2094,"Anyway, I am already used to drinking milk after 4 days when it is very fermented.. The mucus is used to wrap toxins and then the body throws that outSo it is detoxificationWhen toxins are taken out of their storage and moved around your body to be expelled they Gove you headaches etc.. Certain foods can help mitigate itRaw unsalted cheeseRaw tomatoes, raw lemonade, or sports formulaClay milkamong othersjust makes the process smoother and more efficient In glass jars cleaned with zero soap.. Should I bother getting my irises photographed professionally?. It will cost me $150 and an hour commute but I'm not sure who can do the reading word around the block @sarchibones is good at reading irises Don‘t have any juice but a lot of raw milk, is that ok?",5,132
2095,"gonna fix How do you ferment it correctly?. Yes, hot baths 45+ min.. Be sure you have enough bodyfat, cheese train and juice to consume.. Baths may cause more detoxification.. My chikin for breakfast today😅 Thank you 🙏 Any advice for swollen lymph nodes?",5,44
2096,"Does hot bath help?. Just eat a lot of pineapple It’s all good already eaten I eat it for my severe arthritis Because raw chicken is a fear food for many 100% free range😅 Forgot about that It's the tastiest too, imo Why.. .. .. how is this even a question/poll?",5,51
2097,"Did you try it?. Molds are so beautiful?. I just kept it in a glass container like this In a closed glass container the moisture remains and it molds faster ☹️ Cut a piece of cheese today and it had a surprise inside.. Very tasty.. According to AV most, if not all, salmon is gmo So best to store in the fridge without the lid?",5,65
2098,"Nope 👀 I found this bath formula when I got a strong reaction from royal jelly and broke out in hives all over but then closed the page it was on and wasn't able to find it again until now by chance.. ""For Itchy skin: Eating plenty of raw fat gradually lubricates the skin.. Topically, blend ¼ cup of good mineral water, 1 small tomato, or ¼ cup of melon with 1tablespoon unsalted raw butter, unheated above 96º Fahrenheit, fermented coconut oil or 1 tablespoon stonepressed olive oil.. So that the oils are properly homogenized, blend until ingredients are warm to the touch.. Pouring this mixture into a hot bath no hotter than the body is comfortable in and soaking for 15-30 minutes usually bring immediate relief.",5,127
2099,"If suffering with hives, pour into a not too hot bath the mixture of tomato or melon blended with butter, coconut or olive oil (recipe given above), then add ½ cup sundried clay or corn starch, and soak in the bath for 20 minutes.. That will draw the toxicity from the skin as well as soothe it.. The warmth of the bath increases circulation and hydrates the skin which is usually dehydrated from excess adrenaline or drugs, pesticides and preservatives.. Some people would be relieved of itchy skin simply by pouring 1/3 cup raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar into a hot bath and soaking for 15-30 minutes.. To lubricate the skin, add 34 tablespoons of raw coconut cream to the bath water.",5,122

But from a taste pov go for it ig😁 Why did this butter become so moldy?. Best kind of cheese surprise Don’t know how it is in Croatia, but in Belgium it’s best to go directly to the farm and buy milk there, right at the source.",5,83
2101,"Just my two cents 😉 Why did you buy them?. https://getrawmilk.. com/search/ZadarLooks like there's one in Sibenik which is good not too far away, but otherwise I'd just go round a few markets and ask.. I had a good experience with his butter Did it come fresh or frozen?. Thank you, I really appreciate the help!",5,56
2102,":) Is sheeps milk inferior to cows milk?. Yes it does 5 hours of no protein for some people will make them eat their own red blood cells for protein, which is not recommended by aajonus Does this change something to eat only one big meat meal a day instead of splitting the same quantity over several meals?. E.. g.. eating one meat meal of 500g a day instead of 3 meat meals of 165g over the day?",5,78
2103,"Also you will spend more energy on digestion all of that food, 3 smaller meals will be easier on your body The fat content may be different but otherwise it's fine to have either.. Depends what you want to do with it really.. Did you ask beforehand?. Why not buy from a reliable source?. Good stuff is never cheap right.",5,60
2104,"Does somebody know a farmers market in Zadar in Croatia, where you can buy raw milk?. Plus you want consistent flow of nutrients throughout the day for optimal energy that is raw unsalted Kanafa no, Aajonus has a raw salam recipe it's called deli páte.. It means it's not being digestedso it should absorb toxins about as much should come out as well yes any fat could but when you eat cheese and is moderately dry at least butter with cheese is fine with cheese trains so those undigested part remain mostly as they were not really it's cooked so it won't hold + it adds its own toxins you can for both cheese and honey and for cheese trains Have one pc of cheese at 20 to 25 min after the meat meal and then 10 min later the cheese and honey together doesn't prevent toxins from being absorbed can help if you get constipated from cheese (= lack of fat) Helps with fat digestion and digestion in general.. Is this true?. it doesn't digest or not fully Perfect 👌 Salam does aajonus have a raw kanafa recipe?",5,189
2105,"30 to 35 min at least is a good time to wait closer it will interfere a bit with meat digestion Yeah apparently the gmo salmon have been breeding with the wild salmon for decades now and they're all gmo to an extent, iirc from what AV saidHe talked about it a bit in one of the much older workshops from like 2002 Is sheep milk/dairy okay instead of cow?. I know, but I’m asking how pervasive that is Like as in does it even apply to far north rivers and various kinds of salmon Very Afaik AV thought that all salmon worldwide were ruined 👆 Have you ever eaten a real raw chicken?. 🤭🤭 How long should you wait after you have eaten raw meat to then eat fruit?. Right, but even from remote areas?. Like rivers in Alaska Wow.",5,141
2106,"I have never seen chicken with such a nice red color.. I leave at least 2-3 hours between meat and fruit so it comes out as it was you do not digest raw unsalted cheese I consumed nothing but raw cow milk for 3 consecutive days and my stool was beige After consuming a meal consisting of raw red meat, raw butter, and raw eggs, how long before I can eat unsalted cheese together with honey?. Ок For energy Cheese + cream + honey at same time ok?. Actually it's a wild chicken called a duck🤭But still.. Any good bird has red meat, either it's a chicken or not a chicken.",5,111

Probably like animal based, what paul saladino does with less fruit Q: Can A1/A2 be chalked up as BS laboratory theory?. A: I thought so until I started drinking milk from an A2 Holstein.. It made me slightly nauseous and I didn't have as much energy.",5,71
2108,"It certainly tasted good and I felt better with it than without it.. It wasn't as nourishing.. I repeated this 3 times from the same milk from the same cows from New Zealand.. As soon as I went to a place with Jerseys or other A1 cows I was perfectly fine, even in that hot climate.. I don't know how much of the problem is A2 rather than a lack of fat from the Holsteins.",5,75
2109,"I've had Holstein before (but not in that climate), and it was fine.. Goats are a more energetic animal, they make me hyperactive and overly sexual.. You ever seen a skinny, calm goat?. I don't need those adrenaline precursors.. Athletes can use them.",5,43
2110,"Q: Are there animals on Palawan?. A: Yeah.. There's a government dairy that was a test dairy that was New Zealand funded, I get all the milk they have.. They only have 2 milking cows.. They are Holsteins so there's very little cream and fat in them.",5,47
2111,"They are A2 cows, not A1, so the milk is not as nourishing as I'd like.. There is a pretty big dairy on Somal island in Mindanao with Jerseys.. Jersey cows have predominantly A2 milk, and Holstein predominantly A1.. It’s true though that the milk from Holstein cows has less cream in it than from Jersey and Guernsey cows.. Aajonus speaking about microchips in vaccines Yeah just different wording, this was in 2004 keep in mind Well so they say Min-max?",5,81
2112,"It's a month old fyi I just want to say that if you truly want to understand the Primal Diet and further your health as quickly as possible, You MUST by Scott's book and book a consult ASAP.. Honestly reading Aajonus's books for yourself will just hinder your learning Which Scott?. It's an April Fools Day joke Is it normal that when making high meat it can grow mold on it or is it a sign that the quality of the meat was bad and shouldn't be used for high meat?. Where did he release the it for free?. Or do you mean someone bought it and is sharing it I figured that would happen Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time.",5,126
2113,"A long time.. .. .. He himself said Aajonus's work should be free Also expensive which is why most people will buy cheap supermarket meat, or processed meat like sausages and say they're carnivores Where can I get a 32 oz solana gold ACV?. Cooked carnivore is overacidity and digestive issues in progress Other than the PD, would people agree that the Carnivore diet is the next best thing?",5,69
2114,"@leclayrom are these lids good Pretty sure it is to a point Definitely not those would be in the blood hormones aren't toxic like the toxins that cooking produces Alright bro Most ppl function w carbs better than no/low carbs The best I felt on a non-PD diet was when I ate mostly meat, eggs, butter, and sour cream, all cooked/pasteurized.. I was also eating (up to) 3 oranges or similar amount of other fruit daily.. Vegetables never made me feel well and they certainly never tasted good When I make kefir, I leave milk for 2 days standing in kitchen and then I add 2 tea spoon of honey and then when this milk will become kefir ?. I have to wait 2 more days without fridge?. Or I put it in fridge then for how long…?",5,138
2115,"Thank you There is no info about process, but In recipe book .. And still I don’t understand when it will become kefir after I add honey Thanks you can add honey at the start as long as it's a small quantity like the one you gave (it's preferable because more honey at the start will promote growth of sugar feeding bacteria mostly and other bacteria less), that will affect the course of fermentation can add honey last, but it will kill some of the created bacteria (which is fine, it still has a lot of grown bacteria and the kefir remains predigested) Leave your milk in the bottle at a room temperature for a couple if days.. Shake it.. Drink your kefir.. That's it😂*❗Don't forget to close the lid when you shake it.",5,134
2116,"That's very important.. No honey, no fridge, no headache For suuure, I added like maybe 1 full big spoon honey 😁 thought its gonna be good taste it can taste very good without and even sweet (the minerals flavor coming through can do this), but it's often very pleasant tasting with honey, sort of guarantees it by forcing it to go in 1 direction animal based better when it comes to cooked food Milk just ferments on its own even without any ingredient when aajonus was live none of them were raw even if written rawexcept like one brand that could be imported but maybe was not even in stores How about this @leclayrom also storing in a can = leeching heavy metals It's not going to be raw Hairy cheese🤭😅 Yes.. It can happen if it's too humid in the apartment.. You can wash the cheese with raw ACV to get rid of mold.. Thanks This good?",5,158
2117,"Pressed coconut and filtered water.. @leclayrom Make it yourself) it's something he could recommend to people who have trouble digesting protein, not really common in his dieturine is the blood without red blood cells and with added ammoniaavoid morning urine always because it will contain too many toxins from nightly detoxAajonus says on wounds it can save people's lives, he speaks about WW1 and firefighters I was more talking about coconut oil then thai organic life should have this raw not everyone here is muslim bro I don’t trust the coconuts around me.. All I got is Walmart coconuts.. Where could I get some good ones https://thaiorganiclife.. com/ Aajonus claims to have fasted on urine only for 30-40 days.",5,119

Wonder if chewing some weed will help use your brain to control your jaw How effective would the toothpaste formula be if i replaced coco cream with coco oil?",5,119
2119,Dont have cream currently but i have the clay and acv.. Aajonus mentions that he was using BioKleen’s degreaser for his laundry because is was 96% biodegradable..

And that you take it voluntarilySo maybe we have that even now I’ve thought about getting them done professionally too.. The thing it’s most important to have follow up photos taken with the same lighting set up.,5,79
2124,"I’ve seen my irises change over 5 years, but I’d like to track progress and have true evidence to share with non-believers It's a type of toothbrush.. Not sure if Aaj talked about it but it's more natural than other brushes.. Personally I use a boar bristle toothbrush.. For toothpaste I sometimes use just butter.. I wouldn't get too hung up on having the exact same lighting and whatnot.",5,69
2125,There are still features you can pick out even if it's not done professionally.. Having at least some evidence is better than having none at all.. Out of is quicker.. Another question about making high meat; is it better to let it ferment out of the refrigerator or in it?. Or maybe start it by having it out then put it in the refrigerator after a few weeks?,5,68
2126,"Right now I've done it solely in the refrigerator from the start It can have all different types of molds, colours, odors ect.. When trying new high meat or you trying new mold try a little and see how you react.. I’ve been grinding my teeth like crazy for the last couple months Anybody got a shower filter head they recommend?. What was the color of the mold?. Just use a miswak man don’t need any toothbrush or toothpaste ever again What is a miswak?",5,85
2127,"And did aajonus talk about it?. Yeah but then you let it dry to use for cheese trains like is there 3 ring or just one?. Moist cheese isn't aa good at absorbing toxins because it's digested @leclayrom is eating raw pumpkin beneficial?. He recommends summer squash doing physical activity per activity ring means doing it daily?. yes, like 45 min per ring thanks and activity ring means that it has to look like aring right?",5,76
2128,or just curved line which doesnt connect around is also a activity ring?. Cheese yes.. Very important.. Did Aajonus say anything about tick-borne encephalitis?. I extracted about 5 mites of different size from my dog within 1 week.,5,38
2129,"Can they be working as detoxifiers on ppl and animals?. Sucking toxicity with blood?. And  encephalitis is a man made disease from vaccines?. does that mean I have to workout for three hours lol?.

2131,"5-2 hours a day.. If you feel anxious and uncomfortable, add more.. Interesting question!. I’m quite sure that they get attracted to animals that have some or a lot of toxicity..

2132,"She was as skinny as a dog can get, had worms, and had Leishmania.. But I had the impression the ticks were sucking the life out of her.. .. perhaps your theory is correct, and in a way they were cleansing her.. .",5,43
2133,"but the moment she was cleared from the ticks and worms and we were taking care of her, she transformed into a beautiful happy and healthy dog in practically a matter of a month You have a big heart❤️ I had a necessary and unavoidable scan today.. I read to detox from radiation one should eat avocado with orange.. But I have no idea how much, how often, and for how long 🤷🏻‍♀️ anyone has experience with this?. Should I just take every 1-2 hours a small cube of both?. And can I have it with other food, like perhaps cheese?",5,101
2134,"Idk I just meant that the texture of the cheese stays the same like if I put it in my mouth it would still be able to absorb mucus for example and the same goes for other toxicity Seems like more than 3.. You need to take a picture in  sunlight Also the AV/Farmer's method of making cheese is fresh and very moist so idk how that melds into the ""dry factor"" if only you knew Source?. I always understood the absorbant properties of cheese were do to it essentially being a concentrated fat Yes!. The cheese for sure I will eat!. But wondering about the how’s for the avocado and orange 🤷🏻‍♀️ It's not though.",5,116
2135,"It still acts just like a sponge and is never digested Why do you believe cheese will not get effected by radiation Just bc its not digestible?. And dry food will not necessarily be digested you understand right Cheese is unique because the body won’t try to digest it, since its high in minerals and absorbing toxins.. Atleast thats my explanation It has no enzymes/bacteria like all dry food I'm saying that some radiation in cheese isn't a big deal because it's still gonna absorb toxins With your logic a dry piece of beef fat, or any fat, should work just as well Kinda weird to see a nazi page supporting him, I wonder if they knew he was of jewish origin (on his dad's side) The point is cheese is still food, biochemistry isn’t important in this situation what Why not?. The reason it absorbs toxins is because it's dry, undigested and like a sponge.. None of that is affected by one of those machines Radiation effects minerals Which is how the cheese creates the sponge effect Well shit Fuck soyciety Aajonus never said it wasn’t effected, im sure he would of mentioned that if it was possible You don’t know that it will still absorb toxins though Where was that about avocado and orange?",5,216
2136,"In q and as?. Avocado is probably for fats as a solvent.. Make a rectangle and then a lid and then find some cheese cloth at the store It’s in the book, page 257: detoxification of radiation“DETOXIFICATION OF RADIATION is characterized by nausea, nervousness, and a feeling of extreme sensitivity in the body.. Radiation-poisoning can come from medication, medical testing, X-rays, fluorescent lighting, television, computer monitors, laser printers, cellular phones, Bluetooth tech, irradiated food, microwaves, scanners, industrial pollution, jewelry, building material, and EMF's from improperly grounded electrical connections and operating machinery.. Eating avocado with orange, or with melons facilitates the body's ability to discard stored radiation.",5,106

2350,"A: Propolis is tree sap.. Like a tree oil, it turns into rock.. That's why we really didn't have much heart disease until vegetable oils like margarines came in and hydrogenated oils.. They are the ones that cause all the plaque and hardening of the body.. If you take vegetable oils - even raw - and mix them with dirt - in a year that dirt will be rock.",5,69
2351,"If you take animal fats and mix them with the dirt it will mold and turn into dirt.. So the hardening of the arteries comes from your vegetable oils.. The reason the bees take the sap is because its an anti-mite; the mites don't like the smell of tree sap.. So they will line it all around to keep the mites from getting in and eating the bees wax and causing the honey to ferment or ooze out the hive, so they don't really eat it.. I don't think that people should eat it.",5,94
2352,"If you want to take some and break it down - if you dissolve it in some kind of flax seed or olive oil, and maybe put some fruit in it so it ferments (like pineapple) or put it with cabbage juice and cause it to dissolve - it might help you to get rid of some of the hardened stuff out of your system.. The royal jelly is made exclusively for the first few days of a bee's life, and for a queen only.. It is high in hormones for reproducing cells, so there is a higher growth level..

2360,Must be #2 in your country then I eat raw meat and milk I should be invincible tf Btw my primal refrigerator™️ is excellent for making homemade cheese (literally just a mini fridge that isn’t plugged in) The speed the whey drains at is determined by how much weight is on the lid.. Make sure you have something for the cheese to drain the whey into through the holes.. Leave it somewhere where it can mold and remember not to place the lid on for the first day.. Let it sit and drain for the first day without the lid.. Get some uncured pieces of wood and make a box with some nails.,5,113
2361,"Then make a lid also out of said wood.. Smoothen the inside so that there's no splinters.. Put some reasonably large holes in the bottom of the box where the curd will sit.. Get some cheese cloth and put it inside your box and then dump the solidifying raw milk in there.. After a while, place the lid on and gradually increase weight on the lid day by day.",5,69

They then put a lid on so no air escapes.. This makes the cheese mold quickly and will make it taste spicy.. Generally the slower the whey leaves the cheese the more flavor the cheese will have since the bacteria and fungus will have more time to do their jobs predigesting the cheese for you..

The chances of them fining you a person carrying in a few pounds of butter or whatever is really not worth their time I hope this Sunday strategy works w the farm bc then Im clean as a whistle I see from their perspective why it's odd to travel 3 hours for $30 of food The agent was also a dickhead which didn't help..

Well Sunday is a ""pay what you can"" day because this farm gives very fresh dairy so thy are probably clearing out their fridge I guess from their perspective it's more normal and expected if you live close to the border to go to get cheaper gas or groceries.. The problem is if I say I went to Traders Joe's and didn't declare the dairy and thy found it weird I drove 3 hours to go shopping and decide to search my car I can get fined very heavily for bringing in something that should be declared and not declaring it So my situation is a bit different because I'm a Canadian who lives in the US and I drive to Canada every few months, however I also cross that same bridge usually..

2440,The same is with donkey milk.. You can make cheese but the amount is much much smaller compared to cow milk for example.. For example to make 1 kg of dry cheese you need 12-15 litres of cow's milk.. For goat milk it's already about 18-20 litres.. For donkey milk it's 30 litres per 1kg of cheese.,5,57
2441,To get 30 litres you need a livestock.. They give very little.. And to make cheese you have to mix.. It curdles very badly.. I suppose the same is with camel milk.,5,32

I really love primal and raw and I never questioned that 99% of the time And that’s why we say what we say 🙏🏼 It's really not a big of deal for us , here we eat brains , testicle, intestines and so on Most of it cooked for sure but still better than 99%of the rest I understand that raw is the optimal , but it's mot like my diet is useless at this point Raw is always better Any time you eat raw food you are extending your life I understand, I was thinking the same thing when I was carnivore, but really, I feel so much better on raw food.. Just do the best you can in the meantime 🙏🏼 Eat some cow shit, not gonna say it again Cow shit is better than SSri , what if the cow is fucked up I don't wanna get in more trouble trying stuff I just need to be better this year and the rest of my life ik going to be primal no question about that How would it be fucked up, if it isn’t taking antibiotics or eating absolute terrible diet its fine Ssri is just going to band aid the problem I'm aware ,but like I want a temporary relief because I'm studying and in summer i may  have an opportunity to work and then I can be independent so i can afford the diet , but ym mental state is preventing me from thinking clearly and pursuing what I sant It doesn’t matter You destroy the enzymes It's not organic Once I tried it raw , I ended up in hospital But the liver is a good quality ,I always eat it raw When it's available You tried what raw and what were the symptoms Okay, go slowly, eat a very small portion the first time and gradually you will get used to it Vomiting,  nausea and stuff I always ate raw since I was like 3 5 We eat liver and meat raw But now the source is not that good I don't overcook ,I keep it as rare as possible I'm used to it But the eggs are okay for you to eat raw?.

I don't think that people should eat it.. If you want to take some and break it down - if you dissolve it in some kind of flax seed or olive oil, and maybe put some fruit in it so it ferments (like pineapple) or put it with cabbage juice and cause it to dissolve - it might help you to get rid of some of the hardened stuff out of your system.",5,141

I have enough body fat to burn, and am in fat burning mode/ketosis most likely, yet I have more energy and generally feel better eating extra animal fat..

Many toxins store in sexual glands and hormones are dispatched to bind with them But the body burns and metabolises the fat, it doesn’t just evaporate, that’s what I don’t quite understand It’s definitely a stronger sensation than usual I don’t know right, although you could get weird sensations, irritating almost But yeah I get the logic 😂😂 So basically when you eat a lot of oysters it triggers the urge to cum to release toxins you’re saying My dick is not actually crampinh It is caused by detoxification, it's not just plain libidohence the crampingyou could also have inflammationAajonus did say that even his aphrodisiac formulas, the effect could wear off with repeated use.. I'm almost sure it's because of this..

2755,"but in any case it seems safe, Aajonus said he knew a woman who did weight gain/loss cycles every 3 months or so and had very rapid eye changes That makes sense Yeah I don’t think it’s the same process Exactly, and for that reason it would make sense that eating/burning our own toxin-filled fat is also toxic.. I meant maybe it works differently in the sense that our bodies know how to somehow deal with and discard those toxins, different than when ingesting food Just for demonstration purposes, I don’t endorse cannibalism 😁 That’s like cutting up a human’s thigh and eating it while the human is still toxic versus a human who has gone through the detox process I think that’s just so that we don’t take in unnecessary toxinsI think it works the same in an animal’s body, just that animals don’t really go to weight loss cycles you know To convert food/stored fat into energy or break down waste It’s said we shouldn’t eat toxic fatty meats and organs bc that’s where most toxins store, but yeah maybe it works differently in our own bodies Yes To actually understand everything I would need to deep dive into how metabolism actually takes place There is also the thing where when you eat raw fats, the body discards toxic fatsAajonus had an obese client who had huge ice cream cravings, he told her to eat raw ice cream everyday, and she lost all the weight.. (Amen)So in this case it was swapped and there was no weight loss cycle.. I’ll keep that in mind for research purposes The toxins could still stay bound to the fat during that process, why not Isn’t metabolism just the process the body uses to break down the fats?. other things can do itlike avocado with either orange or watermelon And what happens in the body when the fats are broken down also if this happens to you in the first place you might want to eat more before sleep and to wake up before 4-5h and eat again, that might prevent it altogether 😂 How that company sell wide mouth but no regular.",5,361

Mackerel is a cold water fish but they prepare it with salt and vinegar to help kill the smell.. Salmon will only be good if it’s labeled “sake”.. If it’s “shake” it may not be raw salmon.. Halibut is always good rest of year is bad quality Can we do like a poll Lots of Europeans All “sushi-grade” fish is flash frozen I guess it’s just a gamble to determine its quality I know for a fact that most salmon makes me puke because I have whatever Aajonus has that makes him puke after eating salmon.",5,177

Which is huge for people who live with hypersensitivities since almost every food has some level of toxins and environmental toxins are everywhere too.. And I've been having it as a mineral supplement with honey and sometimes fruit and that has made me feel even better giving me increased energy and mental clarity.. TLDR: Raw unsalted cheese for cheese trains, mineral supplement, and emergency toxin absorber is so powerful.",5,130

This way you'd temporarily feel better, so looser joints in your case.. However when your body cleans up most of the toxicity it goes back to more stiff, because you haven't actually sorted the cause of the problem.. In this case you'd actually be deteriorating your joints over time, but you may not really feel it develop that much as it happens bit by bit.",5,283

I know that 80% of nutrients get destroyed but generate toxins no if you freeze them won't it be the same yes I have no health issues otherwise, been doing the standard diet for a year, no cheatingI had the warts for much longer, I believe since 2019 on a cooked dietthey were multiplying back thenbut since 2023 raw primal its been static standard PD And you are like eating the standard diet?. i mean they only grow back after i scrape them but they don’t grow bigger yes i saw lots of pictures / videos they’re warts and  they look like warts?",5,223

2987,"I delete because Aajonus explains the dangers of MMS, this post takes too much space if you want to post it after can you just put the link under Aajonus' quote:MMS is a dissolver and destroyer of long-term health.. It seems miraculous because most of the body's nutrients stop being fed to the microbes that facilitate the cleansing and waste management of old debris and toxins associated with damaged tissues (detoxification).. Because MMS is made of chlorine and sodium, most bodies utilize it to form hydrochloric acid (solvent).. Isolated and concentrated chlorine is a solvent.. It dissolves most everything it contacts except digestive and lymphatic tissues.",5,106
2988,"In the stomach and intestines, hydrochloric acids dissolve large protein-based food chunks so that intestinal bacteria can easily penetrate and eat them.. Bacterial waste is our food.. The body can use MMS to help the lymphatic system dissolve waste jammed in the lymphatic system.. The lymphatic system is our main waste recycler and cleanser.. MMS helps the body's cleansing system to function better with less nutrient expenditure.",5,67
2989,"However, MMS consumption eliminates most of the body's cleansing/detoxification helpers because they are spent and destroyed while trying to protect non-digestive and non-lymphatic cells from being dissolved by the chlorine/salt combination.. MMS begins to permeate all tissues in the body and weakens every non- digestive and non-lymphatic biological process.. An analogy is: the body is a craftsperson and MMS deprives her/him of all of the modern tools so that the craftsperson must make things primitively.. In summary, consuming MMS causes the body to lose its biological helpers in exchange for non-biological chemical processes.. Bacteria is 99.",5,96
2990,"9% of all bodily processes, even a smile.. The energy to produce the smile is generated by non-lymphatic and non-digestive muscle bacteria.. Gradually, energy sources within the body diminish.. Live cells in the body will diminish quicker in most people who take MMS; cells cannot easily divide/reproduce.. In most people who take MMS, deterioration associated with aging is ensured.",5,59
2991,"The Basic Details: Jim Humble (the inventor of MMS) points to academic junk science that has been handed us by those who control industry, especially medicine.. He argues misunderstood conclusions based on assumption rather than true science.. For example, he assumes that chloride (rock) and chlorine (chemical made of chloride) are the same.. He assumes that chloride and chlorine in isolation are harmless.. He points to chlorine being used on meat to destroy bacteria, yet states it is harmless to good bacteria and healthy cells.",5,85
2992,"If you look at meat under an electronic microscope, you will see that chlorine (bleach) will dissolve and deteriorate meat cells not just the natural bacteria on/in the meat.. Humble makes several false assumptions.. He assumes that isolated minerals are digestible.. Isolated minerals are in rock form (oxide).. He assumes that we can digest and utilize rock.",5,57
2993,"Plants eat rock and thrive, humans do not.. Humble states that it does not cause imbalances like other remedies, but he does not give any credible laboratory proof.. Chlorine (chemical) that is not a natural part of plant or animal tissues and not delivered with other nutrients is not natural and causes blood and body imbalances.. He states that the chlorine in MMS is as safe as the chlorine in table salt.. Once sodium and chloride are combined chemically, the minerals are no longer in rock form.",5,87
2994,"Sodium chloride (table salt) is processed and is not safe.. Yes, it will aid in digestion by helping the body produce more hydrochloric acid as I stated above, but not safe hydrochloric acids for the entire body.. The long-term toxicity may not be noticed for decades.. I won!. 😂 Humble also states that MMS does not harm the body's good bacteria.",5,61
2995,"He refers only to digestive bacteria.. MMS will eventually permeate all tissues.. Consuming MMS concentrates chlorine and sodium.. It is an imbalance.. If it were a balance, don't you think that the body would naturally contain such a solution?",5,39
2996,"My assumption is that the body has been working wonderfully for millions of years because it knows how to balance itself when fed properly.. It seems harmless to intestinal bacteria because intestinal bacteria normally live in a hydrochloric acid (high chlorine) environment.. However, taking blood bacteria or most non-intestinal bacteria into such an environment would be like taking freshwater fish and putting them in salt water.. Humble states that the non-biological sodium in it will dilute and be harmless.. Any sodium that is NOT in a biological solution with other nutrients is destructive.",5,93
2997,"Pure sodium is an explosive more volatile than nitroglycerin.. Anyone who has a hard time conceiving that salt is an explosive, I suggest you watch this video where salt is sprinkled on DEAD frog legs: http://www.. youtube.. com/watch?. v=2YZJt_Bw3eo.",5,39
2998,"(How Stuff Works explained it as:""Because these are fresh frog legs, the cells inside them are all still intact.. The biochemicalmachinery still functions.. There is still a source of energy for the muscles in the form ofunused ATP molecules stored in the cells.. All that the muscles need is something to activatethem and they can still contract and relax (until they run out of ATP or something else shutsdown the biochemical machinery.. ""After reading that ""scientific"" babble, consider that, in a video by the same fellows on a skinned frog leg prepared at the same time, they sprinkled 3 times more pepper on the leg as they did salt, yet there were only 2 twitches.",5,115
2999,"The twitches were because there was a little salt in the pepper.. With pure salt applied, they twitched for about 20 minutes, until the sodium was spent.. Additionally, sprinkling calcium, potassium and phosphorus separately did not cause twitching, only the table salt.. )It is possible for anyone to test the effects of MMS with 2 good electronic microscopes in a 98 degree F.. high-humidity room.",5,65
3000,The person tested should not have consumed MMS for at least 45 days.. Rub some MMS on a fingertip and prick that fingertip to extract 2 drops of blood.. Spread the blood gently on a thin glass plate (slide).. Prick a finger that did not come in contact with MMS and also spread the blood gently on a glass slide.. Watch and compare what happens to the blood cells in both situations.,5,72
3001,"In the non-MMS-exposed blood, there is no panic, just a slow acceptance of the death that ensues when blood is exposed to oxygen out of the blood stream.. In the blood exposed to MMS, watch the white blood cells eat the MMS, trying to protect the red blood cells from contact with MMS.. Time the blood cells’ decomposition.. In an hour, compare the coloration of the dried blood masses.. Repeat the experiment several times.",5,74

3013,I would say that there are quite a few factors that are important.. 1.. Using rennet has time benefit for sure especially for those who make a large amount of cheese at one time.. Imagine having 100-200 litres of milk at once and having to wait it naturally clabbered.. 2.,5,50
3014,If we take a relatively small amount of milk and don't skim it rennet isn't necessary.. 3.. Rennet helps to regulate sourness.. If you aren't an experienced cheesemaker and clabber your milk on the window ceiling you can oversit it and it will develop too many unnecessary bacteria which can make the further cheese sour or bitter or molded and all kind if surprise.. Especially if you can't control the temperature and humidity of the place it's kept in.,5,79
3015,4.. We can't say rennet is bad.. Rennet has been used by people for centuries and if it has natural origin it only helps.. Using natural rennet doesn't mean you have to heat the milk.. Rennet can be used in fresh warm or room temperature milk as well.,5,48
3016,"5.. As for taste in my experience it's influenced more by the quality of milk, food of the animal it was given by, aging conditions, attention and experience of the person who makes the cheese more than by rennet..

Same guy What about this comment regarding raw milk Thanks rom.. Celery has oxalates, but less than other vegetables.. Aajonus warned  that spinach for example had  too many oxalates.",5,106
3056,"So if juicing spinach it would need to be 5% max of the whole juice to limit it.. The oxalates are fewer in celery and when juiced, the minerals from the juice bind to the few anti-nutrients that remain, so you are just left with nutrients.. The anti nutrient thing is irrelevant, aajonus has people drinking cups of celery a day and he would of noticed if the “anti nutrients” like oxalates caused kidney damage or caused malnutrition ect.. In theory yes they may contain oxalates and cause damage however aajonus or anyone who has done the veggie juices for years would notice the negative effects, which hasn’t happened.. Yes but we had vaccines, they give us mutant antibodies which destroy the proteins in our blood in less than 5 hours, so we need to eat more often for this reason (as well as general toxicity).",5,146

3193,"With a caveat:Short term celery juice can give you a bit of detox and make you more thirsty and crave some fruit, because of that detox, but by being consistent after a few days you are balanced and it fulfils your needs perfectly it's not even because of ketosis, at least aajonus doesn't speak about it this way, it's just the protein requiring fat to digest so it rips off fat from your tissues because you didn't eat much fat and have a lot of proteins to processalso eating one food at a time leads to less weight put on, if you were to eat egg + meat at the same time then that combination would make you store more than egg - - - separation of 30 min or more - - - meat I think you can have tomato with celery juice, yesOnion and basil are less common, I guess that makes it some sort of gazpacho soup, as long as onion, basil is not more than 5% it's fine wow i never even thought about this so just plain celery juice or should i add other juices just plain celery juice, can add up to 20% of parsley juice as well could i add carrot juice or nah yes if it's like 20% celery is low sugar and carrot high sugar, so by keeping carrot juice 20% it balances it, you should still lose weight But nuts should be fine as well, right  ?.

A: Propolis is tree sap.. Like a tree oil, it turns into rock.. That's why we really didn't have much heart disease until vegetable oils like margarines came in and hydrogenated oils.",5,153
3266,They are the ones that cause all the plaque and hardening of the body.. If you take vegetable oils - even raw - and mix them with dirt - in a year that dirt will be rock.. If you take animal fats and mix them with the dirt it will mold and turn into dirt.. So the hardening of the arteries comes from your vegetable oils.. The reason the bees take the sap is because its an anti-mite; the mites don't like the smell of tree sap.,5,87
3267,"So they will line it all around to keep the mites from getting in and eating the bees wax and causing the honey to ferment or ooze out the hive, so they don't really eat it.. I don't think that people should eat it.. If you want to take some and break it down - if you dissolve it in some kind of flax seed or olive oil, and maybe put some fruit in it so it ferments (like pineapple) or put it with cabbage juice and cause it to dissolve - it might help you to get rid of some of the hardened stuff out of your system.. The royal jelly is made exclusively for the first few days of a bee's life, and for a queen only.. It is high in hormones for reproducing cells, so there is a higher growth level.",5,144
3268,"It will cause magnification of cell division like up to 10 times.. Usually for humans it is 3 or 4 times.. That's why I say in the book, if you're going to eat royal jelly only have it with meat or else its a waste.. Because that's where you get the proteins for regeneration.. So the hormones and the proteins together will function; otherwise those hormones will go to sexual activity, or running or any energy activity.",5,77
3269,"It won't go for cellular division.. ” Everyone laughed, it was a good time oh, how come?. unless the upside to insects so very huge and nearly no downside, i don't think i'll ever consider eating one They’re definitely not as nutritious as other meats so it’s kinda pointless to make it your main meat Same yeah Mosquitos drink blood so I wonder why Sv3rige doesn't promote those Also a lot of insects eat rotten meat and poop so Aajonus might have said they're fine Is blending 5 eggs and drinking them pointless?. Blending it with 2 bananas and raw milk, just for a mass gainer I’m not doing full primal yet, i live in a shit location To remove all other meat and be fed only insects, that’s the problem with the agenda Okay so just 1 banana per day?.

3290,"no vaccine I am not sure registering with the government, as an LLC or corp for example is an issue, but if you are talking about registering as in getting a license, yes that was absolutely a huge mistake.. Once you apply for a license, you declare you are operating an entity that they have jurisdiction over.. I believe all state laws say that if you are one of those entities, your operations must be open to inspection at all reasonable times during business hours, and once inspected, if they find anything they don't like, they can shut you down until you comply.. This is why Aajonus originally had them under a lease where his organization, Right to Choose Healthy Foods, leased his entire farm and had 100% rights to all the products produced..

For this though, if you get cravings it can be because you let yourself get too hungry, then you binge For Aajonus weight loss is easier done by eating one food at a time, if eating many foods combined at once they can tend to store more easily My family dosent even give a shit I’m FOLLWOING PD tried to stop me wasn’t able to plus they don’t know who’s giving me advice and who’s not I take my own responsibilities no not you So dosent matter tbh You think I’d sue u guys 😂 For legal reasons Why is that?.

I wouldn’t entertain that idea at all Haha If its in need of nutrients its gonna tell you Its always one spoon then half the jar is empty💀 Obviously it depends for me when I ovwreat on fiber and fruit I tend to undereat protein and crave it less Experiment with your own body I often started my day with fruits recently and they were like 40-50% my diet and it was making me undereat on protein as well as crave these fruits constantly which translated to my gut working poorly Dont reccomend that not on PD though If you have toxins moving you will lose hunger, but you need to eat to remove them Otherwise Aajonus agrees but there is this big exception Yeah I believe that your body needs resources but if it wants to fully focus on detoxing it doesnt want to use resources digesting food at the same time thats why your hunger goes away and when i get sick I want to sleep I go to sleel for an hour or two and wake up feeling like a new person and then my hunfer comes back your body from my experience doesnt want to be disturbed when doing something as much as I love Aajonus for his work I dont believe we should listen to anyone blindly and experiment with out body personally I'm a fan of listening to the signals my body gives me and it worked we so far Does anyone have video where aajonus talks about George bush For most carbs if kept at around 10% is all they need unless you are very active Really like when I ate cooked food I was hungry even I eat 3 full meals, I was full but hungry, and now on pd I am full and not hungry after 2 meals and I am feel like it’s enough, I feel bad when I overeat I mentioned when I slept not enough I much hungry That's right haha cooked food has way less nutrients so your body has to eat more of it meanwhile on raw foods diet I can go whole day being full with a small breakfast and a bigger dinner So real Amd when you overeat which sometimes happens for me when I eat fruit I feel bad too haha Fruit and honey is the only way to overeat For me atleast Feeling bad after overeating is possibly just your body saying its too much work at once and itll have to use more nutrients than it needs to digest it He said something like There is a secret society / conspiracy and he was talking about money Honey is delicious and you eat eat eat can’t stop everything the normies touch is ruined i tell as many people as possible whilst trying my best to not be obnoxious about it i try to spread health and wisdom how do you want us as a population to not be controlled by the government whilst actively hiding the key to freedom from people this is wisdom that is to be shared.. if people on PD preceding you didnt have a sharing attitude, you wouldnt know about PD yourself, and would remain to live an unhealthy life I have a lot of these lines actually..

Eggs are not enough to hydrate you on their ownWater is bad for mucus and so for leaky gutMilk is a hard food to digestAlso, when eating a lot of raw eggs, Aajonus mentions you need green juiceSo it's pretty sure it's implicit you need green juice too on the leaky gut protocol why lol Super idea if you aren't injecting green juice into your veins you aren't doing primal aajonus didnt write so many books and made so many interviews just to have edgy elitists let the teachings go to shit RULE #2 OF THE PRIMAL DIETEat plenty of raw animal fat..

This toxicity causes a significant increase in disease and degeneration, and shortening our lifespan.. Fat is the main thing to dissolve, surround, bind to, and enable the expelling of those toxins.. A single molecule of mercury could require 50 to 200 fat cells to eliminate from the body.. So we do not need that much fat to provide energy, however, since most of the raw fat we eat goes to handle toxins, we need that much more of it daily.",5,104

Even then you’d just eat more fat and juice Yeah it can be harsh because that fuzzy mold (the mycelium) eats dead root canals in nature and in our body it eats dear nerve networks, so you feel these sort of gaps appearing and you need to eat enough meat otherwise it can really leave gaps and create cysts, then the meat creates new nerve tissuejust have to keep up basically and it can be debilitating for 1-2 days I guess if I ate the fuzzy bit of mold it would cause like a really harsh detoxing process?. So it would be better to eat a little Whats the best food to grow mold on also any specifics on how to do it?. But its totally possible to make it without heating Its supposedly a little easier to separate curds or something Also dont understand why would you heat up the cottage cheese Aajonus gave a figure of around 1h as sufficient when on this raw diet.. @leclayrom how much sun do we need in a day?",5,237

Besides removing toxins, they also break down food into smaller particles, pre-digesting it for you, which magnifies the benefits you can get from the food.. They use very strange recipes I don’t know why are you holding goats or whole farm and do cheese with bacteria culture or heating wtf Yeah the more of the pineapple I eat the more burning I have but now I ate butter and it calmed tomato is low carb and in watermelon aajonus recommends the lower carb part to be eaten so them being ripe is less of an issue Maybe this is the reason why many of them sick almost as citizens Wym What's Q&A are left to be transcribed?",5,174

3515,The best offtop chat ever🥳😁😂 Yeah me unfortunately Iris Why do you need to know that @arthersy Isn't it better to live in ignorance in our full of aluminium world?. 🤭 Idea is - if you know such people pay them to get their dna scan and compare with others If someone body is 'vaccinated' it seems that many of them produce spike proteins months after Hey folks It’s all poison https://www.. youtube.. com/watch?. v=OI_OhvOumT0 In my opinion covid vaccines aren't that much different than regular vaccines.,5,87
3516,"As much as toxic and dangerous than regular vaccines, but not more toxic and more dangerous.. ""mARN technology"" is just one more layer of bullshit on top of the vaccines bullshit.. Science doesn't really understand how ADN and mARN work, ""mARN technology"" is just marketing coming from big pharma.. Aajonus didn't speak of this since he wasn't around but these should be universal what you would use for any foreign objets which is raw fats, and solvents (pretty much everything in the sports formula), plenty of minerals (oysters, cheese with honey) Hears bromelain and NAC do that Detoxing from spike proteins and covid vaccines?. There is even a vacuum juicer doing it for many months already.",5,116
3517,highly recommend it.. This is an interesting thing to explore Best is indeed to transfer it to porcelain or glass How about the GMO salmon?. Probably everybody that has been injected has patented DNA now.. and for the celery juice I highly recommend storing it in vacuum glass jars.. otherwise the nutrients oxidize very quickly.,5,55
3518,"especially when you just cover the bowl with a towel, oxygen can travel freely.. storing the juice under vacuum makes the juice taste better (fresher) for much longerhttps://www.. youtube.. com/results?. search_query=mason+jar+vacuum From the iris you see a general toxicity and the area, but not so much the specific toxin Thanks Mercury is black spots, rusty color is other metals Hey everyone, what are the best pans to cook with?",5,69
3519,"So what instead?. Cast iron of course not teflon pans Wuth cast iron you can even cook on the fire in the wood🤭😁 RULE #4 OF THE PRIMAL DIETDrink enough raw celery juice.. Only celery juice can protect your body from certain toxins that will otherwise continuously damage you: it is the irreplaceable main remedy.. The Primal Diet emphasizes the consumption of celery juice and that is the main thing that separates it from so-called ""raw carnivore"" diets.. Aajonus agrees that we are a predominantly carnivore species and are meant to eat mostly raw flesh as our diet.",5,98
3520,"However he notes that from his observations of carnivores, they occasionally chew on some leaves.. Why is that?. He states it is not a coincidence or mistake, but done with a purpose: it acts as a remedy to them.. There are some compounds only found in plant juice that will help the body remove certain toxins.. Carnivores only need a few drops to balance themselves.",5,65
3521,"In our case, since we have accumulated much more toxicity from our environment, the amount of such plant remedy we need is significantly higher.. Otherwise, many of those toxins will remain in our body and continuously damage it.. Aajonus recommends an average of 4 cups a day (2 cups would be the bare minimum).. The required amount can vary importantly per individual, it could be more.. Note: Celery MUST be organic, celery can be one of the most sprayed vegetables, non-organic celery juice could cause more damage than it helps you.",5,91
3522,"The only known replacements for celery juice are sugar cane juice and unripe (green, hard) papaya juice, if you cannot find celery.. https://www.. instagram.. com/aajonusbasics/reel/C6cRX4Koygj/ 😍 primal fridge @leclayrom you know if it’s plastic or it’s ok?.

3523,"Stainless steel Where all vaccines and toxins acumulate It can cause minor plaquing, its mostly vegetable oils tho It's subpar, just tastes like water to me.. Try chewing it up into a pulp in your mouth and then using your teeth to filter out the pulp Iirc, he claimed any fat that has absorbed toxins already will simply pass through the gut, if it's still raw that is By itself yeah with carrot and cucumber it slaps tho I think he said only for fresh Cooked saturated fats cause atherosclerosis?. What do you think, aajonus said cooked fat has 10 times the size of raw fat , cooked fat cause atherosclerosis or just toxins and vegetal oils are the cause?. So the problem from cooked SAT fats are the toxins not the plaque Aajonus says that eating too much bell pepper can cause very intense neurological detox.. He says to have very small amounts I mean i cant eat raw fat on social meetings ofc raw IS better but if i have no alternative isnt thst bad as vegetal oils?",5,180
3524,"No.. Saturated animal fat being harmful is mostly myth The problem is plant fats.. Oils from vegetables Thats i thought, saturated fat just cover calcium plaques for protect heart and arteries This part here seems to be my weak point but quite honestly from what I see online this area is spine and thyroid which I dont think I have any problem with but maybe im wrong or iridology is bullshit in itself quite honestly seeing one maybe would help That is fuck all, and that is your intestinal lining barely anything else You got crohns ring And you might have a lot of toxicity and degeneration in areas but have no symptoms if you have good basic health, later in life you will have big issues there though I heard aajonus said muscle meat safe but idk about the fat Yeah that would make sense Personally had no problems with it yet The same should by my logic also imply to egg shells and so I wanna see if I notice any bone mass increases or anything in particular by eating egg shell powder with mixed in honey Now its this hazel green after vaccines prolly Primal Diet chat: My cucumber tastes like ass.. Help.. I laugh too hard at these comments sometimes 🤣 Not MY cucumber specifically.",5,219
3525,"ALL cucumbers 😫 Gonna do a little experiment with egg shells Ao the theory is that they are just like cheese enzymeless and full of minerals especially calcium which your body uses as its main mineral to bind to toxins and it does work in a detoxyfying manner just like raw cheese However if you mix the raw cheese with honey you can instead of detoxyfying absorb all of the nutrients from the cheese by adding enzymes from honey Most iris’s i read i see lots of degeneration but little symptoms in younger people generally It tastes delicious as hell the consistency of a pudding I read somewhere that Aajonus recommended that if you want to eat eggshells, you need to soak them for several days.. But I don’t remember what exactly.. Possibly in milk IS raw meat from supermarket safe?. On my city i cant find farms Yeah, he used to do this, then discontinued egg shells altogether because he found issues with them, micro lacerations in the intestines, and preferred cheese with honey.. The only thing he used eggshells for I think is to fertilize the soil Idk but I personally have eaten small raw chicken bones from chicken wings?",5,202

3530,Don't watch it I wont Why can't u drink raw milk after celery juice?.

Too much sugar/carbohydrates, even if raw, is toxic for our body.. It poses two important issues: glycemic imbalance which leads to energy crashes, and accumulation of toxins like AGEs, that cause 1/3 of diseases.. The body only has around 4g of sugar (glucose) circulating through the blood at a time.. Some of it is also stored as glycogen in muscles and in the liver.",5,115
3539,"It only converts other macros like fat or protein into sugar on-demand.. This is different from plants which store their energy as sugar.. Eating more a few carbohydrates drops the blood-fat level, and raises blood-sugar level, making the pancreas overwork through speedy secretion of insulin to get rid of those excess carbs in the blood.. This first creates a sugar spike that can lead to manic behavior and hyperactivity.. Then it is by followed by an energy crash, leaving us mentally and emotionally fatigued, irritable, sleepy, and/or depressed.",5,88
3540,"Monkeys that live on fruits are overly emotional.. Carb digestion also creates AGEs (Advanced Glycation End-Products, a glycotoxin).. Columbia University's Department of Medicine found that those store in a healthy body at a rate of 70%, and in an unhealthy body at a rate of 90%.. AGE is a corrosive substance, like an acid, that accumulates and eventually melts tissues, creating sagging skin, muscles.. It predisposes the body to cancer and many other diseases.",5,74
3541,"After modern civilization brought native people processed and cooked breads, sugar and alcohol, natives developed all of the diseases that ""civilized"" mankind suffers, including cavities, diabetes, osteoporosis, and cancer..

Salt is a rock, and our body cannot process rocks.. It has a toxic effect, different from the sodium found as a nutrient in plant or animal foods.",5,57
3563,"Water dissolves rocks, and plants eat rocks, then animals eat plants, and we eat the plants or animals.. This for us is food, the minerals are made into nutrients, becoming bio-available.. Rock salt is very different from the sodium found in food.. According to Aajonus, rock salt is an explosive.. Rock salt is a mineral formed from sodium chloride (NaCl).",5,60
3564,"When eating rock salt, during digestion, the sodium is separated from the chloride, so the sodium ion becomes isolated.. Isolated sodium is more volatile than nitroglycerin, this is when it becomes an explosive.. So during digestion and after, this isolated sodium creates micro-explosions in the blood, destroying other nutrients and killing cells.. Additionally, when the isolated sodium doesn't explode right away, it can draw other isolated sodium ions to itself, creating sodium clusters, and the magnetism of them can rip off the guts of cells.. This makes using rock salt the second worst thing next to cooking in standard diet practices.",5,101
3565,"One million red blood cells are destroyed by one little grain of salt.. When part of raw foods, even during digestion, sodium is always bound to other nutrients, they are always connected on a chemical level, it doesn't get isolated and therefore doesn't have this damaging effect..

3629,"raw milkshake).. That is to prevent being in a state of autophagy.. When you eat foods, the digested nutrients end up in the blood, available for the body to use.. They do not circulate infinitely in the blood.. After as little as 5h, or even 4, 3, 2 hours, depending on the person, all those proteins in the blood are gone.",5,61
3630,"This is caused by our toxicity, and what Aajonus called mutant antibodies.. The toxins damage the protein nutrients in our blood stream.. The mutant antibodies are created in reaction to vaccines, and behave abnormally: they break down healthy protein, wasting it.. This is why healthy specimens that have lived in very good environments (such as non-polluted nature) are not affected by this, they can fast, they will not be protein-deficient after only a few hours.. What happens for us is that when our body runs out of protein because of toxicity, it has to cannibalize its own red blood cells to generate protein, which both weakens our body and makes it consume its own toxicity, since our bodies are at all times discarding stored toxicity, so eating our own tissues exposes us to more damage from our toxicity.",5,138

He ate up to whole raw 60 eggs a day, did lab measurements, did not have any biotin deficiencies.. There is plenty of biotin in egg yolk so even if avidin took part of it away, it would leave a surplus, but what actually happens is that avidin and biotin create a compound together that helps the body detoxify leftover carbon by-products from macronutrient digestion, so it is actually a good thing.",5,115

3749,"RULE #11 OF THE PRIMAL DIETLike heals like.. Eating raw meat can repair the similar specific tissues in the body.. Eating raw foods detoxifies the toxic by-products of cooked foods that were eaten in the past.. For example, in case of liver damage, eating raw liver can speed up healing.. For anyone that ate cooked dairy products in the past, eating raw dairy will help pull out the toxins from those that ended up stored in bodily tissues.",5,78
3750,"Each food has specific bacteria, and when an organism dies, its own bacteria consumes it, which helps recycle it.. Therefore it will allow the same to happen in the body: debris from cooked foods will be removed efficiently by a similar or identical raw food.. The bacteria will seek it out and has the proper design to process it.. The nutrients from raw foods give the body ammo to detoxify their processed, toxic counterparts.. Raw iron binds to toxic iron which allows the body to neutralize it and escort it out.",5,91
3751,"Raw calcium removes the cauterized calcium from pasteurized dairy, etc.. This works even with raw versions of foods that are not exactly the same, but more or less related.. For example, eating muscle meat will heal muscles faster even if the cut of meat being eaten isn't exactly the equivalent of the muscle that needs repair.. Drinking raw celery juice can detoxify past cooked greens (among other things), including cooked plants other than celery that were eaten.. This is a general rule, there can be other rules that are more important to heal a given body tissue:Sometimes the best remedies are not just ""to eat the same thing but raw"".",5,110
3752,"Taking the liver damage example from before, Aajonus would recommend first and foremost to eat a lot of raw animal fat.. Eating raw liver can also help, but in this case it is not the main thing.. Another example: If one ate plenty of cooked sugar, which is made in general from either sugar cane or from beets, then it is not necessarily raw sugar from those foods that are best to detoxify it: Aajonus would mainly recommend raw celery juice and unheated honey for those.. https://www.. instagram.",5,88

I personally think babies probably just naturally like sweet foods as they're similar to breastmilk, so I was just wondering if there can be any dangers with giving him so much.. I genuinely think that the brain and body of a child that hasnt yet been brainwashed knows best what it wants so you should listen to him but as Rom said if you feed him cooked food it creates enzyme deficiency which maybe is why he craves honey for the enzymes so much Thanks, I get the liver from my family's pigs.",5,147

As for the relation between organ quality and safety, please check this out A lot of honey even if unheated could cause a protein deficiency You can try and see how it goes if he gets raw organs instead of cooked ones if not then just give him little less honey because it has enzymes which seek out protein, so if they are not provided it can seek them elsewhere Why are you cooking the organs?. ?.

Then, the group that was eating frozen and was getting sick got placed on the never-frozen raw butter, and healed.. Aajonus concluded some foods could lose around 80% of their nutritional value from being frozen.. For certain foods, such as meat, freezing can also generate toxins from the proteins, in addition to destroying nutrients.",5,94
3782,"For these reasons, Aajonus preferred average quality fresh meat over frozen high quality meat.. Fruits are about the only foods that can be eaten frozen without issue.. Still, after they thaw, he recommends to eat them fast.. Fish that would survive freezing and thawing are another exception.. Since they would literally start moving again and resume their life after thawing, the kind of fish (such as Arctic Cod) that can endure this only loses a small amount of nutritional value, and can be eaten frozen without issue.",5,87
3783,"Finally, raw ice cream (recipes using raw cream, such as the ones Aajonus gives in his book The Recipe for Living Without Disease) can last up to 24h without losing substantial nutritional value.. It is recommended to flash freeze as that damages it the least.. If you consider using frozen meat to make high meat, thinking the nutritional value doesn't matter as much here, but only the presence of some bacteria, Aajonus also discourages this: the bacteria are changed from freezing, and they will induce more radical detoxifications.. https://www.. instagram.",5,90

If microplastics were found even on an uninhabited island Then every river and water body in general is polluted to some extent Well toxins are spread everywhere because of air its all in the air too The worst are nanoplastics honestly Thats flaw of every low carb diet eventually Aajonus says the best source of glycogen is proteins, that get converted into pyruvate Carbs can gives you better explosive perfomance but its a shitty fuel since you can store no more that 300-400g which IS 1600 kcal , with fat you have unlimited energy while you have body fat How do we know the problem of those low carb diet is the low carb aspect and not other hidden aspects like them being cooked or them being no plants because of trying to avoid carbs in general Yeah, I am aware that if needed, protein can convert into carbs, however if that would happen that regularly that it always feels up all the glycogen stores, there is no place for ketosis in the organism Since body works with a large amount of carbohydrates pretty often.",5,319
3786,"Yes, but again that does not answer my question about empty glycogen stores when you on ketosis Which is fuel for muscle nonetheless According to Aajonus this happens in the first few hours of the day, the body making glycogen for the whole day.. And with protein it does it cleanly, while with sugar it generates a lot of toxins and obstructs the body's function Interesting.. I think even some proteins would not be suitable (from toxic sources) What are your experience working out while on ketosis?. I once worked out fasted and almost passed out and had shitty light headed feeling for the rest of the day.. I never measured ketosis levels, even when I was eating ""carnivore"" and working out, or fasting, so I don't know.",5,128
3787,"But aajonus didn't really seem to find ketosis to be a goal in tiself I've had this too I'm not talking about levels or accurate data Just asking how does it feel working out without carbohydrates within your system.. I don't fully understand what do you exactly mean Do I buy the jar The problem IS if you dont leave ketosis state for example people with keto diets  lowers test after months without leaving ketosis How does that work Well, we cannot really do anything about it on a global scale.. Besides avoiding plastics (which is impossible if you travel often enough) as much as you can and living healthy lifestyle.. put butter in milkshake today was good Fun fact: Inuits also eat a fair amount of carbs due to the temperature there preventing rigor mortis, therefore the glycogen remains intact.. Fun fact #2: marine mammals have higher glycogen stores to assist deep diving.",5,154
3788,"nice btw if we are talking about glycogen primal diet is a relatively low carb right Yes which is not optimal for T production?. and athletic performance in general Hormones are made from fat so eating more raw fat should enable the body to make the hormones it wants, that's what PD claims and fat for energy as well Does anyone have experienced  Amos Miller butter smells like bananas?. Carbohydrates lower cortisol levels a lot, which leads to more testosterone Is glycogen which is made of carbs in muscles is fully replaced by fat?. Athletic perfomance IS a scam, you can do BEST worktouts of bodybuulding or football with carbs , but with fat you can walk during hours or run a bit with more energy than carbs In theory why would you experience cortisol on PD It’s toxic juice for toxic humans, brutha Pders juice heavy coz the minerals help with detox and all the animal flesh they consume lowers their ph significantly Apparently tho red and yellow meant to be appealing to the eyeballs cause it reminds us of blood and fat Saw some argument that eating eggs before bed is mandatory (not coming from primal adopts) since they contain cholesterol which is building block for your testosterone So good I’m obsessed with it Sounds sooooo good Heard warm raw milk and honey before bed is fine yea depends on the food Isn't a clear topic And it depends which food too So if anything, eating before bed should be good asf Raw food is fast and easy digestible though Raw food meant to be easy to digest anyway ?. yea I could never tbh Eating before going to sleep is certainly not beneficial for your sleep.",5,289

Take 45-minutes-long hot baths, use hot water bottles at night, or do physical activity.. (But avoid saunas.. )According to Aajonus, 90% of detoxification occurs through the skin..

3832,"However, they are only deposited under the skin.. It is still required to sweat for them to come out.. Leaving those toxins under the skin can create substantial discomfort and damage over time.. Besides from his main diet advice, this is one of the most important quotes from Aajonus:I recommend everybody – unless they’re an athlete who sweats ever day - get into a hot bath for 40 minutes.. It’s important because that will stay under your skin and if it builds up year after year, it causes deterioration of connective tissue, destruction of skin, and can lead to lupus, MS, destruction of your nerves - all of your tissues internally.",5,111

Therefore, whether through sports, hot baths, or using hot water bottles (that you can sleep with at night for example), it is necessary to sweat often.. Not only is it necessary to avoid potentially severe damage being caused long-term, but it immediately can remove feelings of lethargy, irritability, unease, makes one feel lighter, clear-headed, can help with appetite issues, sleep, healing, and body function overall.. Notes:Saunas must however be avoided because their temperature are too hot and damage the skin and mucous membranes..

3841,I don’t like tomatoes at all and the thought of drinking them makes me sick ngl Would they use chemicals like a pool Are there people from Msk?. Could you please share where you buy products and your experience like why you entered pd They can I've been eating 1.. 5 😁 МКАД/МО?. All products from MO anyway😆 Someone is claiming Aajonus wanted us to eat 3 tablespoons of butter with each meat meal and 6 if you are skinny.. Is that true?,5,83
3842,"He seems to not understand МКАД 😁 I have just tried one.. Tasted good.. Was cracked, kept 1 month inside a jar.. But i wonder what's those pieces inside.. .",5,30
3843,.. .. Could it be something starting developing 🫣🤭 Is it ok to go in public hot springs ?. Hi everyone.. Had anyone had high eggs with mold on them?,5,30
3844,"Yes Ok thanks “Unless theyre an athlete who sweats every day” Every day is better but it's not necessary for most people to do that much, just every 4 days is enough in general.. Sometimes you will get detox, itchiness before 4 days though yes but look Doubt anyone would be able to help But I get a crazy pain near/around my belly button/ abdominal area occasionally.. (Id say it happens every few weeks/couple months)To the point where I actually can’t stand up fully straight.. If I stretch or twist , pain would be excruciating.. It only lasts like a day then goes when I wake up the next morning/ gets better I don’t know if it’s intestine related, muscular or what.",5,122
3845,"I can’t work it out Yeah I didn’t said that the hotter the better but it's a good news if you can handle hot temperatures, then you can hot baths for extended periods of time and people often struggle with that By the way So what regiment athletes should use?. Do hot baths on rest days It's still good to take hot baths, it will more evenly make you sweat, and help with recovery but they already sweat out most toxins ?. I don't get it Sure It's the same for them but they need it less He essentially says “until you are an athlete, do hot baths everyday” What athletes should do then?. Not do them every day or do them at rest days Rest days is fine Homunculus😆 Yeah i made mine the same way except i just strain out most of the whey and i call that cottage cheese it’s phenomenal i prefer it over pressed cheese We'll see later.. In the guide you say to have 200g -500g of animal fat.",5,175
3846,"Does the fat in the meat still count into that?. @leclayrom Yes homemade raw curd cheese contraption 👹 this shit taste exquisite This is cottage cheese yeah you dont have a cheese press?. curds and cottage cheese are not necessarily identical but yeah.. and no i dont have one unfortunately, but this is already amazing as is.. rich raw milk taste and some pleasant fermentation (i usually dont find sour fermented dairy tasty but this slaps) it's called tvaroh here where i am from 🇸🇰 the difference between tvaroh and cottage cheese is mostly the whey content as far as i know tvaroh being cheese curd, mostly without whey Where do I find cheese cloth like that?",5,117
3847,"Mine sucks oh that's so locally dependent.. i got this from my family, as my mom used to make cheese and had leftover cloth.. 99% of the time, any local sourcing question can be answered with ""befriend your local farmer(s) and ask"" they most likely do their trade longer than you might have even heard about primal diet, they usually know the best I mentioned not only saunas Do you mind sharing iris pics?. as much as you want Yes, a kind of new life.. I have a few more😂😂😂 That bladder sits right under the navel.",5,97
3848,"I have noticed I get a similar pain on days I wake up dehydrated with very concentrated urine.. It’s as if in those days I was also dumping toxins and they were so concentrated in my urine that the base of my bladder burns.. But I only feel it when I flex my abdominal muscles like when I get up from laying down or stand up from being seated, and it’s an intense sharp pain, usually last all day and then goes away.. So I chalked it up to both letting myself get too dehydrated and intense dumping occurring at the same time.. Appendicitis can only last a few hours/ a day or so?",5,114
3849,"It's a big problem with my diet lately.. I crave high foods only.. No fresh meat, fish or eggs.. Only milk and cheese are fresh.. Have high foods, then detoxes, suffer, die, suffer, crave again.",5,35
3850,Has anyone ever had a similar situation and what does it mean in your opinion?. I believe it finishes soon.. Probably lack of some bacteria.. .. .,5,27
3851,"I start to crave high food really fast, I am barely month on diet, and I solve it with kefir, my stomach feels good with e.. coli Kefir is very good yes.. Love it too.. My cravings are mostly stinky stuff like high fish, moldy cheese, high eggs etc I stopped with fish for now.. Waited for a week and today i had juice of half a year old liver and this egg😂😂😂 Might be appendix issues You’re right.",5,79
3852,"It could be actually What would be the best way to go about this?. Would something be causing  the pain Honestly don’t know Aaj’s stance on it, so I’d advice to seek professional help If you do some kind of resistance training stop it ASAP Check this topic Thank you people.. Will look into it The 3.. 5 figure I remember because of the meat being converted into energy otherwise but if you eat fat all day long then you don't need to do that u have appendicitis how much meat for 3.. 5?",5,94
3853,"no clue tbh it doesn't burn you but it starts destroying vitamins, enzymes, and other things nonetheless Hot baths and cheese trains are a main big thing that speed up everything, also some amounts of ingredients maybe but i don't remember fully rn Already addressed this earlier I posted it here Hmmm I see a slight change But what matters more is how you feel Changes in mood ?.

The purpose of this diet is to give health and prosperity but at some point is it really doing that if you do things that you feel aren't prosporous That's how I see it anyway Aaj also had an alternative for suppositories that I would try before it using some kind of seeds Idk eating your own poop Never seen that in nature Its just very old local meme I don’t even remember I have this as my pfp lol I don’t wear caps anyway since my head is fucking gigantic I mean omnivores But idk man even if im going to be superhealthy i wont eat my own shit f that Damn I'm just saying in nature it's common not uncommon Primal diet helped you?. you don't at all have to in order to do the diet The context of my question was how exactly diet helped you do people that do this diet use a stop watch seems retarded The very basic concept is to drink celery juice and then eat raw meat and repeat And then layers add up You can't heal without having fat with meat dont rely on blood tests taking AV's teachings and pursuing further research is something Aaj would be very proud of himself I believe Pro athletes for example who abuses shit loads of steroids to the point that their natural production is so scewed Mind sharing your insights in DM’s?. i would love it if it wasnt just DMs, actually :D Idk if its allowed here So i don’t wanna set up my homeboy accidentally oh i see i'd think it is since it's based off of PD Laura can u explain what is the gums Applying same mechanisms with different approaches/food Can you recommend a few ?",5,493
3858,"If you share your experience in DM i will be grateful as I mentioned better health with some non pd things as regime of sleep etc but primal making my lifestyle complete, and I think there something more I can do although primal diet is the name, aajonus includes other things in it like sleep and hot baths, he gives health recommendations outside of diet as well Sure Sounds good I live in Barcelona and doing primal for more than three years..

I learned that there are many ways to achieve the same rates of healing and cleansing through my own theory crafting with primal, and that primal isn't the only way you can heal your body Why?",5,123

They are some of the most fucked up people we've had to deal with, really vile, insane, pieces of trash.. Good to see you know Irene, I'm not surprised she's involved again..

I joined again now to ask you about this specifically Why are you hiding that you heard this from Lina and her kin?. You are using all these tricks to ask me questions because of her, then you act defensive and condescending when I tell you the people who lied to you are criminals and their accomplices pieces of trash human beingsI'm not asking you anything, I'm just telling you what it is, you don't need to act defensive and tell me what is or what is not the topic, about people who slander me for 2 years, try to ruin my life and the life of others in various ways, and are the reason you are here in the first place..

Anyway all clear now.. I crave for nut formula so bad, what can be the reason?. Aajonus recommended no more 2 times a week but I already eat it 4 th day in a row Could be lack of animal protein, making you crave nuts Such a nice color for lube How is it so dark?.

There is someone called Lina (real name is Katarina), who has been slandering, and harassing us for 2 years.. She is a criminal wanted by the UK police and harassed a woman together with a group of proven pedophiles.. She is constantly attacking any cheese I sell (not just this one, I work with other farmers in France), and lying about us in general, to thousands of people in general.",5,107

3876,"The Pinullet shop was already selling a type of raw unsalted cheese that some people in PD groups living in Barcelona were purchasing.. That's how we heard of it.. Then we contacted him and asked him if he was willing to change some of the process to make it even more as Aajonus would have wanted it.. For example, there was a 1% salt bath used once at the beginning and we asked if he could try without, which he did.. That made the cheese get much harder to predict in its evolution, some of it would go bad and we invested thousands of euros, which our cheese orders were funding, to get it right.",5,115

3976,"You will benefit from an eating window of up to 30 minutes without toxins dumping into the gut.. Raw unsalted cheese very efficiently absorbs the many toxins that the body deposits in the gut, which enables painless detoxification, and to improve digestion significantly.. Aajonus discovered that raw unsalted cheese doesn't digest, but instead absorbs toxins very efficiently.. For almost everyone, many toxins store in the gut.. Since the stomach is very resilient and contains digestive acids, the body deposits toxins there, where the acids can neutralize them.",5,87
3977,"This also gives a chance for the toxins to get eliminated from the body by being carried away with the food going through.. However, most foods end up getting damaged and contaminated by the toxins that the body dumps in the gut, and many of those toxins end up being ""recycled"", stored back into the body.. When eating raw unsalted cheese, the cheese, if truly raw and with no added salt, draws the toxins to itself and neutralizes them with its concentrated minerals and fats.. Therefore, eat a piece of cheese (around half a teaspoon to a teaspoon) 10 minutes before you eat any other foods (whether solid or liquid, even water).. When you first eat a piece of cheese, it will go and collect the toxins, clearing the way for the food that you want to eat next.",5,139
3978,"This improves digestion significantly (making it around twice better), and appetite.. Wait at least 10 minutes after eating that piece of cheese, no more toxins will be dumped in the body for up to 30 minutes, so you can eat without your food encountering toxins, and get improved digestion.. If you eat before the 10 minutes have passed since eating the piece of cheese, the body will deposit more toxins in the gut, but it will still be less than if you didn't eat any cheese at all before.. The total duration of this ""toxin-dumping"" cycle that is reset by the cheese is of 40 minutes (similar to the duration of REM sleep cycles).. https://www.",5,115

Same thing happens to me I tried some crackers a month ago got a headache a few hours later Must instant salt detox Sorry for being rude i see what you mean Definitely get an adrenaline rush Drink sea water and tell me you ain’t dehydrated no its just diarrhea good detox fr Aajonus talks about the ions resulting from the body processing the salt, making the cells unable to eat and that they would shrivel like a raisin Very specific concentrations of salt, when you add salt to water like normies do this is what happens to their blood and imo why it causes an adrenaline reaction because you get anemia temporarily from crenation..

I used to ask myself these questions but I never decided to google it I could be wrong on the exact figure, but it's on the ""Early Training with Aajonus"" book It could be but aajonus has made claims that scientists have never scraped the surface of so it could still be true What u think @leclayrom cause imo aajonus kinda ruins his opinion on salt with the explosion statement.. For science normies anyway There was a woman who was doing raw carnivore in the Phillipines and the freshly cut meat in the markets was convulsing non-stop.. I haven't seen nowhere else, but I haven't looked for it She had a YouTube Channel, Asra Conlu or something She changed to cooked carnivore last time I looked it up Sodium is very volatile, you need it bound with a smorgasbord of nutrients so it doesn’t have to seperate on its own and then find a cell.",5,232
4341,Sodium in salt is also a very large amount.. Sodium from salt is the largest “electrolyte” particle whilst natural sodium is the smallest molecule..

Way more concentrated then any natural sodium you would find bioavailable in whole foods.,5,60

If the mother smokes during pregnancy, or even if she’s been smoking a few years before, the child’s not as smart because those tars get in there and start blocking neurological transmitters.. So no there’s no, usually for women who are pregnant it depends upon the toxicity in the mother, if she has a lot of toxins in the body you wanna eat a lot of cheese often so you don’t go into morning sickness..

RULE #12 OF THE PRIMAL DIETDo not eat frozen foods.",5,76
4570,"Freezing foods, even if they are raw, destroys most of their nutritional value for most of them, and for some even generates toxins.. Exceptions include: fruits, fish that would survive thawing, raw ice cream for up to 24h.. In Aajonus' experiments, a group of dogs fed frozen raw butter developed diseases such as mange, while the group fed never-frozen raw butter remained healthy.. Then, the group that was eating frozen and was getting sick got placed on the never-frozen raw butter, and healed.. Aajonus concluded some foods could lose around 80% of their nutritional value from being frozen.",5,98
4571,"For certain foods, such as meat, freezing can also generate toxins from the proteins, in addition to destroying nutrients.. For these reasons, Aajonus preferred average quality fresh meat over frozen high quality meat.. Fruits are about the only foods that can be eaten frozen without issue.. Still, after they thaw, he recommends to eat them fast.. Fish that would survive freezing and thawing are another exception.",5,66
4572,"Since they would literally start moving again and resume their life after thawing, the kind of fish (such as Arctic Cod) that can endure this only loses a small amount of nutritional value, and can be eaten frozen without issue.. Finally, raw ice cream (recipes using raw cream, such as the ones Aajonus gives in his book The Recipe for Living Without Disease) can last up to 24h without losing substantial nutritional value.. It is recommended to flash freeze as that damages it the least.. If you consider using frozen meat to make high meat, thinking the nutritional value doesn't matter as much here, but only the presence of some bacteria, Aajonus also discourages this: the bacteria are changed from freezing, and they will induce more radical detoxifications.. https://www.",5,129

4641,🧀On day 3-4 you can combine soft cottage cheese from two cloths into one and tie the cheese tighter.. 🧀 You can hang the wheel in a cool dark place.. It will still give some whey.. Put a pot underneath.. 🧀 It's very important to change the cheesecloth into a dry one every 24 hours.,5,55
4642,🫀 It is very very important to keep the cloths dry!. If you want to get a good tasting cheese.. Just have two cloths and wash and dry them every day.. 🧀When you get the desired weight of the cheese wheel you can stop adding more milk.. 🧀Take care of the cheese wheel you have gotten.,5,56
4643,.. Don't let it hang in a wet cloth for a long time.. Unnecessary bacteria or maggots may spoil your work.. 🧀 Take into consideration that if you want to get semi dry wheel from 12-15 litres of milk it may take up to 2-3 wheeks of your everyday attention.. 🧀If you want very soft white cheese - 1 week is enough.,5,62

They seem good now but when it happens theyll be more fucked Fruit meal at some point or do sport formula Not detoxing This is probably a stupid question but I know people who have had more vaccines then me and have a terrible lifestyle but have perfect skin,  hair etc how are these peoples bodies handling the amount of heavy metals in them @leclayrom I got a pretty big cyst on my head that I pooped open and it’s quite bloody..

4687,"2.. Prolonged nervous tension, emotional instability, frequent experience of stressful situations are often the only cause of sweating.. The more stable the psyche, the less sweating under stress.. The hair in the armpits slows down the evaporation of sweat.. However, they are not the cause of it, therefore they do not interfere with a healthy person.",5,56
4688,"Deodorant will not affect the sweating process and the amount of sweat released will not change.. The composition of the deodorant contains antibacterial components that reduce the number of bacteria, as a result, fewer odorous products of their vital activity are formed.. Also, deodorants contain flavorings.. The effect of using deodorant is temporary, since bacteria quickly restore their population, and the application of the product has to be repeated over and over again.. Antiperspirants have no effect on the bacteria living on the skin.",5,84
4689,"The effectiveness of the antiperspirant is determined by the presence of aluminum salts in its composition, which, when applied to the skin, cause narrowing of the excretory ducts of the sweat glands, which prevents sweating.. It's a very tough method.. In order to get rid of the unpleasant smell, it is better to use lemon slices.. I only drink one or maximum two cups in the morning of celery juice I get diarrhea and stomach pain.. Bad body odor usually occurs when consuming the following products:🥃Alcohol🚬 Cigarettes🧅🧄Onion, garlic and various spicesCabbage, asparagus🥜 Legumes☕ Coffee, 🍵 Tea (not herbal)🍫 Cocoa and chocolate🥩 Red meat (especially highly processed - semi-finished products, smoked meats, canned food)🐟 Fish 🥚 Eggs 🧀🥛 Dairy and fermented milk products🌱🍯🥭 Adding celery, parsley, honey, fresh fruits and berries to the diet will help improve body odor.",5,138

It's boring to sit in one place all the time I think the problem is not that there is a lot of red meat, but that people are not physically active enough, they need to take out adrenaline and all these hormones..

Also this stretch will release tension in the jaw.",5,65

This is Aaj approved alternative.. 2nd time trying this hopefully I sweat like a fat person lost in the fukn sahara Well, it has nothing to do with the starches Try to cover yourself in blankets to promote sweating She whispered it in my ear before she moaned ""daddyyy"" No normal people don't have to watch body language masterclass Issa root vegetable 🥕 yeah, but do we need traditional starches, like potato rice bread and all of its derivatives?",5,145

I started doing well but then I was cramping so terribly bad even laying down following anything primal bc of no toxin release I had to stop.. It's hard to do the diet without having your ducks in a row.. I'm doing my 2nd attempt at hot water bottles today But I didn't sweat though I came close.. So now I'm going to add 3 of these things.,5,88

4821,Got a half gal of whey from the cheese I made yesterday.. see how I feel drinking it for a few days And I got sunburnt top of my forehead Is Tabasco and hot sauce bad?. and that is why he quit the diet he used to be able to sit out in the sun for 10 hours a day without a sunburn and when he incorporated celery juice he couldnt sit in the sun for 25 minutes thoughts?. It's good stuff I'm sure 10 hours is pretty crazy for sun exposure no?. natural humans should be out in the sun for 10 hours a day I haven’t been out much in sun primal joey said that celery juice made him sensitive to the sun Salt is bad and Tabasco is salty.,5,132

I understand and i agree for the most part, but nothing to be sure of, only people protecting each other and claiming to know the truth Nah, just look up different animals giving birth, ALL eat their placenta.. Usualy with the chord still attached to the baby Iceberg hello I don’t like the idea of comparing us to animals when animals don’t have a sense of morality I think it’s wrong but we can agree to disagree All im thinking is the elite oligarchs of the world would love you 🤣 Eating a Placenta ain’t got shit with morals Yes indeedMorality comes from religions, planted in our minds.",5,168

Then he slowly got crazy Someone here recommended a tribest glass blender.",5,74
4824,I think this is the way.. Aajonus knows what he talking about but I think this is one of the times where his autism might have taken him too far.. I have a mason jar compatible Oster like Aajonus suggested and it's bubble city.. The Oster may fit a mason jar but it sure as heck wasn't made for a mason jar.. I seen videos of the tribest the oxidation is way lower it seems So your Stance is that we are just physical beings with no inherit compassion before religion cults?,5,92
4825,"Yes Thx for sharing I'm gonna look into this The difference between more based atheist philosophers of the past and the Redditors of today was that they used to be honest about the nihilistic consequence of their world view and Redditors operate on their forced presuppositions about morality.. That's one reason I cannot respect them Great thank you A lot of things are much better to pulse than full on blend, bubble city means quick cream and butter.. We have the capability to inherit feelings, but also the means to be manipulated by those feelings, wich the great elite is aware of.. Therefore they created morals, to keep us enslaved im snorting this raw meat like its cocaine I haven't seen him for 7 years Usually got sugar in too Every animal in nature eats their own placenta, i got Lucky enough to taste it..

This is also an addiction.. To be fair hes right almost everyone in modern society is addicted to something What is I'm just saying to say that normies arent immune from being mentally ill Part of the reason i stumbled upon the primal rabbit hole is because i was researching ways to improve my mental illness Ive always had anxiety, depression, addictions Sv3rige offers health counseling lol Terminally online feels almost better we get dopamine from new info and social media Imagine being wagie your whole life Lol Thats a retarded take tbh At least working actually builds character Eh When the raw primal diet is mainstream who will be a normie?",5,237

The diet is whole life… i don’t understand though hes really unhealthy Wow I seen this happen to some drug abuser online I remember Pimple sort of thing.. Did it come from the nipple or a gland around it.,5,65
4851,"Its not uncommon for the gland around nipple Its the body pushing something about the skin Most likely  with white blood cells Who is this 40 year old?. What is the intention of the raw primal diet?. What are the markers of the successful biological detoxification?. If you were to grow up naturally in a forest, you would not have to use these tools because you would not be toxic/vaxxed.. Celery juice, hot baths and other primal recipes are only required because of our modern environment and a cure for modern conditions.",5,92
4852,"If you grew up in the forest you could just live off of raw animal foods and fruits.. Ah I see.. So it’s just a way to eat.. It doesn’t have a moral, ethical, physical or spiritual motivation?. It’s just a bio diet?",5,43
4853,Autism isn’t real?. Or is caused by toxins…?. Didn’t he have a child that he neglected in these pursuits and a wife he cheated on?. He had prophetic dreams?. But no spiritual or moral values?,5,35
4854,But people in this community are not from the forests.. They’re online all day… and most could not manage if they didn’t live in cities… most are not even functioning irl Huh?. They share more similarities than differences ….. Its true Look at his fans I thought he ate high meat He lost the plot years ago He did but he doesn’t talk about it anymore Even if he's 50% aajonus he still shares good content Hes not the worst and he definitely help people learn about foods Just really silly Now he faps about black pill looksmaxxing Lost the plot He shits on body builders which is good I found this wild berry bush and almost all of them have at least one tiny bug or bacteria visible roaming around in thereThat should mean it’s pesticide free?. Facts 😂 Yeah If its wilds very rare theres pesticides unless someone is bother to walk there to spray it 😂 Way more nutrients Helicopters Idk Maybe chem trail fallout https://www.,5,169
4855,instagram.. com/reel/C7pbKz2ysi3/?. igsh=MXZ1ZmdiMjB4b2hqYQ== Is the only concern People like Sam sulek do far more harm than people like sv3rige I don't understand the obsession with this guy Im not saying hes harmful or very bad just silly Preys on certain weak minded people to look up to him People i know go to the college he is at they start nutting about him in a gym Shit like that hes a joke Sverige is silly and not that healthy he uses filters on his videos so he doesn’t look as bad and teeth are rotten.. Pretends he doesnt have a blatant hairline transplant I don't see how this is related to your intialy q.. It seems like you just want to shit on PD.,5,124
4856,"Not at all.. I’ve done the diet and I experienced the benefits This is a diet.. Not a philosophy.. I’m just trying to understand the underlying motivation, and if the other aspects of wellness are ever addressed No?. You mentioned that someone in nature would not have acess to modern tools that are needed for the diet.",5,57
4857,"I said they would not need them.. Your reply was niggas on the diet are shut in losers.. I don't really get your point.. Are you saying that the diet leads  to that?. Yes, it's a only a diet.",5,39
4858,"You can still follow any religion, spiritual practice (as long it's not fasting lol) or philosophy you want.. No I’m just saying that in nature there isn’t a dogma around diet because it’s survival.. Will coconut oil pressed at up to 40 degrees be beneficial to me?. It's a massive cope.. They don't even get that living a slightly more toxic life would trump their miserly primal shut-in life.",5,69
4859,"""but um le less toxic"" lol What’s wrong with fasting?. I’ve read the book but I don’t remember the portion on fasting?. Can you send it?. I also question the author, and the people that promote it.. lol AV said you should eat animal protein every 5 hours, otherwise your body will canabalizzze on toxic tissue.",5,56
4860,"how cares bro After five hours of not eating red bloods cells start consuming each other to put basically Something like that We’ll promoters of fasting say autophagy, the body will only consume the bad cells.. Bur aajonus says different that it will still consume healthy cells of not eating protein Ye He and sv3rige share a lot of similarities don’t compare aajonus to sverige And that fasting can stop detoxification because we need nutrients for optimal and clean detox Also fasting produces negative hormones and stress on the body Why are y'all so obsessed with him It kind of makes me like him Not that hes really against it but he would promote to not drink dairy Ty.. I literally can’t walk rn lol Even if you dont agree with the system you cant change it sitting on your ass The monetary system is meant to enslave us It invokes spirits Shower won’t engulf your body to heat it up.. And unless you have well water it is toxic It's a way to channel demons Doesn't have to if you have prayer alongside it i want to sweat toxins and seed oils out in shower how do i achieve this then it's not yoga but stretching or some bs.. Yoga is tied to hindu spirituality You can use hot water bottles and cover yourself in blankets Then it sounds like the opposite of satanic Hindo spirituality is satanic.",5,239
4861,Hidu Gods are Demons bruv You should not even do Yoga without a Yogi since you can invoke spirits without knowing That's worrisome then How is yoga satanic You need a Yogi spirit guide when doing yoga otherwise you open yourself up to possession they are small bro on what You can by joining a yoga school with good reputaion that has a yogi/yoga teacher that ideally learned from a real yogi in India.. Still I would not recommend it and  would look for other physical exercise or spiritual practice Impossible.. YOG-a has goy in it lol Lay 3 towels down put 1 between calves 1 between thighs 2 outside hips 2 under arm pits one towel on top.. Then you need a down comforter which I don't have so I just used my blanket.. All water bottles wrapped in a pillow sheet I haven't done them @bludiamhim.,5,148
4862,"You can try it that way just make sure to cover yourself in mad  blankets when you do it so you sweat proper Do you believe that about meditation too, someone once told me it creates the vulnerability for spirits to come in Yes I do, but it depends heavily on the type of meditation and the intent of the meditation.. I could write a book about this.. I have been attacked  by ""bad energies"" when meditating as a teen and after was afraid to meditate again.. I only recently started doing a ""silent prayer"" which I guess is meditation.. Can I give coconut oil to the vegetable juice?",5,109
4863,"Wow maybe you will write a book.. Id understand being afraid to meditate after.. Do you feel more protected during silent prayer, and are you just saying a prayer in your mind, heart, body rather than just sitting in silence trying to silence thoughts?. too strong detox How do I get one, they just need to be a spirit guide doesn't have to be an actual physical teacher?. Hot water bottles Yoga is satanic what can i do if i have no bath will hot showers do in other group we have yes.",5,93
4864,".. .. Gotta do hot baths man Evolution is fake I prefer hot springs, and I don’t have hours to sit in hot baths.. Do they have hot springs where you live?. Where are you from?",5,36
4865,"How many primal people or people on this diet do you all spend time with IRL?. Just curious What is IRL?. Offline Well then we have a disconnect in conversation, but that was just my opinion.. How would you do edging offline?. I’m sorry?",5,44
4866,"How can you do edging offline man?. It's not possible you need internet bro Can you tell me what you believe?. A handful Interesting that there’s a handful of people in one area Some come and go Is this the Scott hall amish group Scott hall funky dancing group now some overlap but still very different he speaks of hot baths, exercise, it's not just diet either No Did AV do yoga?. yeah What kind?. I heard him talk of one pose specifically I forget the name for how long I just sit in silence while I'm trying to be observant of my thoughts and the feelings they create.",5,109
4867,I'm watching myself and my body while being aware.. I feel safe when doing the silent prayer.. The entire approach and perspective are different for me.. It's not meditation with the goal of enlightenment or any other personal gain.. It's staying in silence to get into the presence of God.,5,50
4868,"In that, it's easy for me to see the spirits or emotions that arise for what they are without being afraid of them and knowing that they have no power.. Perfect For the past month I have been drinking vegetable juice with a whole lime, a whole lemon and a piece of ginger like two fingers.. The ginger is steaming and the citrus is sour.. Can I drink that much lemon lime and ginger?. 2x per day Man sun on ballz is nice Just flash them quick Like legit 15-30 seconds to start I remember when i started my nuts burned in a minute or too 😂 Damn hot sauce and raw steak is killer That area is probably never been in the sun so we have to start really short peroid Just need lots of milk Go out in nature or open a window How do you feel?",5,149
4869,"If you have sun after night shift, is it fix that you dont sleep all night?. I think it helps somewhat but nothing major Then you could sleep just in the sun Like 8h sleeping in the sun I actually need peace and quiet to sleep and it's noisy outside my house.. Also I can only really sleep in pitch black So you're not telling me to go on the night shift?. I have a choice, but working in the restaurant kitchen at night is much cooler - there is no one, calmly, you can turn on the music.. And also, no one pushes me to work - I can do sips, cheese passes as much as I want and whenever I want That atmosphere at night is so amazingThat is why I am thinking about it seriously That's the exact reason why I like night shift.",5,147
4870,"Much more calmer and the job overall is easier.. Alot of people who went from nights to days have had mixed feelings about the switch Some say they still can't sleep much and others say that it's a big improvement on their mental health I'm also not convinced that humans are strict dinural I can't imagine a tribe of humans sleeping 8 hours straight in the wilderness And one more thing.. I'm temporarily working in the kitchen and breathing all this terrible air-burning oils, and all the other food.. It's harmful.. If I work at night, I won't breathe it.",5,100
4871,"I will breathe only fresh air + I can afford cheese passes and sips Considering that this is temporary, about a month.. Maybe night shifts are worth it?. Hundreds of times less toxicity Fucking.. I wish I could sleep 4 hours a day like Aajonus So you gonna wake up at 2 am for what It's terrible.. I know from experience I’d say it’s worth For real I did not do hot baths.",5,73
4872,I did juice.. I experimented with doing all of it.. I do not like unsalted cheese it tastes medicinal.. I don’t think the diet is bad at all.. Damn ye that's my issue too But I would If I could Should I juice watermelon rinds or eat them whole?,5,49
4873,"Shit man I know it's not good Raw beef should hell I guess so Yes Would mushrooms help Is the night shift bad?. If I'm on a strict primary, will night work every day be bad?. And yet, how can you reduce sleep time without losing recovery?. It's very bad bro Sunlight is vital Your circadian rythm will become very distorted Night shift become zombies Yeah but most people who work typical shifts are the ones missing sunlight since they're at work all day Trust me In the office Good point Our society is so toxic How do people in Alaska cope without having sunlight That's why i am glad to work outside For half the year I work night shift and I know it's bad; I plan to go day shift in the future but when I get home from work I lay in the sun for about 1-2 hours That's really good bro Atleast you get that sun, very healing I would recommend sunning your taint and balls too.. Unironically it increases your bodies testosterone production naturally Lmfao I don't have that type of privacy at my house This dude said taint and balls At least working you have a chance to impact the lives of others That's probably because they are paranoid about so many farm animals being vaccinated and injected with hormones Sv3rige and its consequences have been a disaster for the Primal Race So this is more of a cult I’ve never heard anyone say it’s white to drink raw milk Yeah as far as I know some of those African tribes lived mainly or raw milk on* Large % of their diets You’re here?",5,280
4874,"But I thought this was just a diet?. Apples and oranges But what if sv3rige is autistic?. He didn’t care about his own child unless it was in the context of saving his life to promote himself Well he shared vulnerable and negative things about his child, blaming his ex wife and autism…completely excusing the fact that he played a role.. While also allegedly saving his child’s life and using the story to essentially start a cult and profit off of the fatherless, ill, autistic etc Yum Again I think the diet is a good diet.. Much of what AV promoted is actually just esoteric diet (without the spiritual components) and native wisdom.",5,113
4875,"I thought a wolf brought him a rabbit?. A wolf has nothing to gain Irony is wasted on the stupid Can you guide me on why  sticky yellow fluid comes out of my nipple is something wrong with my diet?. Some kind of bacterial detox I guess No Only when squeezed fluid comes out Not yet No No pain Yeah Maybe because he was fatherless?. lol I love consuming people Mmm Eating shit and the healing powers of raw herbs The jobs are used to keep us busy golem SS?. Your parents didn’t raise you from birth, and once you were a teenager you didn’t exist to them?",5,108
4876,"I don't deny some work is good but most of work is going to fuel the 3rd world taking over i’m asking are you an SS News flash.. Those are all drugs Telegram, social media, online relationships.. Escapism is equally addictive.. Correct and even then it was a story to further his own agenda.. Sv3rige does the same things.",5,59
4877,"based Wtf does meditation have to do with satan great to see one of us You just said you didn’t see the similarities and I’m just speaking to a few of them.. Making money from his retard worshippers the sigil Lol Yeah man attacking ur gf with corrosive acid, thats just life ya know?. Totally comparable to your standard relationship problems Well one could say that sv3rige is promoting the diet to help people.. But he allegedly has other motives?. If aaj was so pure in what he was doing then why do their lives share many common themes.",5,99
4878,Why is there such an overlap in the following?. Rom is probably the only person on the diet or in the community that actually cares about others health and has any morality.. Isn’t that just the gnostic believe that the God in the Bible is actually Satan and that the snake actually enlightened Adam?. Sv3rige promotes eating foods in specific ways to maximize their benefits?. It’s just raw food for thought Allegedly.,5,72
4879,"Who knows what the works of AV would have denigrated into if he wasn’t a martyr Consuming others Any guidance Aajonus didn't try to KILL his son and wife For sure Would a raw beef diet help me?. Look how many specific remedies there are in We Want To Live for each condition Ah I see.. I think that organ therapy started in TCM?. They pull out free radical heavy metals Not the beneficial ones nigger is chad For example the body cannot utilise vitamin B1 from a supplement the same way There’s some overlap with Ayurvedic modalities and remedies as well, and he pulled a lot from traditional tribes.. I understand that he was selling a diet and lifestyle and that it works.",5,124
4880,.. but I’m confused as to why the other aspects of health are never addressed.. Which other aspects?. u mean like others specifics health issues?. Did Aaj ever talk about drinking blood?,5,32
4881,"Like the Massai tribe Balance within the body, spirit and mind.. I think that explains the community Aajonus did talk about that he actually said it was the most important thing and how people on cooked diets can still live a relatively long and happy life That's exactly what tribes people do I definitely want to try that I’d be interested in reading or listening to that.. Would you mind sending It was or it wasn't the most important thing?. I haven’t seen the quote in a couple years i can try find it Again none of this is an attack on anyone doing this diet.. I’ve done it, it takes a lot of discipline.",5,115
4882,I never experienced detox though?. I just felt good.. Did you do hot baths and juice?. And berries?. amazing.,5,19
4883,".. .. but  some extremistics says that cooked meat is worse than vax .. But clearly the diet taps upon unprecedented things such as our ancient history.. We are the way we are today because of the choices of our ancestors, one of which being the food they consumed.",5,49
4884,"Which triggered the right biological markers through hormones and enzymes to evolve us into what we are today.. The diet would not work if it was not closely related to the nutritional level of primordial man Things likeWhat each type of meat doesHow to make the most out of themFood combinationsThis is what we are showing in the ""rules of Primal Diet"" on @primal_diet No one said that My next phase after primal Eating raw animal foods, and some fermented foods, for instance, are principles shared by several people and Aajonus was not the firstBut if you look at how far Aajonus took it, and many other aspects that differ, it's on a completely different scale Aajonus writes in the book that he left them My friends said I gyno Being irresponsible as a severely autistic person vs trying to kill your family is not the sameThe values they promote are not the sameGatis promotes amorality, ""do what you want"" kind of attitude, with an emphasis on edgy things like killingIf you read Aajonus you will see he was a completely different person, not only in the values but in the personality Ok It could be natural tho Sounds like gyno ?. Maybe a hot compress What is the problem with the ""agenda""?. Aajonus recognizes his flaws in the book and the wrong he did What's that Hot water bottle Because eating raw meat is considered edgywhen it's actually normalJust like some people make raw milk into something of racial superiority, this was literally never on Aajonus' mind when he spoke of African tribes drinking 90% raw milk lol Aajonus never really made a family though, so he probably still had issues Thanks I'll take the compliment Are you the standard for what morality looks like ?. Like I said.",5,300
4885,"I think the diet is a good diet.. Much of what AV promoted is actually just esoteric diet (without the spiritual components) and native wisdom.. tribes don’t use ancient or ancestral wisdom to sell ideologies and diet What are you confused about?. I don't get what ideology he is selling, all I see is him making claims that food X + Y are remedies for a given condition A connection to nature and source.. Self reliance.",5,76
4886,pretty much just the results of his observations (that were repeated enough to be deemed solid enough and work on most people) Let me be clear that I’m just curious.. I am in no way attacking the diet.. Isn’t the given condition the industrial world?. These are the reasons I see him and sv3rige as more alike than different.. Didn’t Weston a price discover and write these things before AV?,5,70
4887,"Sorry I'm not sure I understand what you mean when saying Aajonus pushes an agendaAs for WAP, his work was not on developing advanced health protocols like Aajonus did There is an entire world between raw carnivore and Aajonus' diet, and same between WAP diet and Aajonus' diet Wet ass pussy diet What do you mean how far he took it?. Hop on over Thats garbage Ur right lets move it There a chat if anyone wants to join https://t.. me/sv3rigeexposedchatroom Average Sv3rige excuser Forgive and forget Everyone makes mistakes we all do Yo guys Sv3rige invented eating raw meat he made some good points too This is a lot of people who are totally out of the loop Same morons that say he promotes family values.. .. .",5,129
4888,"while he helped orchestrate and likely paid for two attempted murder arson attacks on his son and mother of his son.. He just took a few things from Aajonus and made his own diet No he says Aajonus is wrong about all sorts of things He's an aajonus disciple so he is worthy of some respect We have someone in the channel so they can check if you're there I hope you really do mean your friend and not just yourself Your friend is a loser My friend irl bought his paid content lol Money doesn't exist, but make sure you give your money to him 😉 Green juice being the main one Yeah like having sex with girls when they get their first period and killing babies and drinking their blood Sv3rige mocks women who have children at an older age and call them failures.. He also mocked women for not being virgins and called them uselessProceeds to marry Primal Belle who has 3 children from 2 different men before him and then gives birth to Gatis's daughter at age 35 Nothing he says can be taken seriously Hes the reason this chat is full of dumb fucks now I disagree with that sentiment So many people in here would also argue that sv3rige is still good because he ""brings awareness to raw primal"" Good on you man.. Too many people turned him into some hero and even more guys with absent fathers turned him into their online surrogate father.. Having to part ways with that was very difficult for many of his sv3rige fanboys.",5,266
4889,"I found primal diet before i even knew who sv3rige was i didnt need that clown to tell me about it They all think they are not slaves and ""owning the sheeple!.

Bro I could try pulsing but somehow I doubt it would make much difference I've just given up on it now after seeing the lack of bubbles someone else got making a few primal drinks Why is sv3ringe in legal trouble?. theorically rotten blood would help Try better beef An animal doesn’t have much organs anyway.. It makes sense not to eat them in abundance.",5,267

I find that to be rather strange.. i drink juice i enjoy it i just dont like eating raw beef can u do this diet just doing dairy and eggs if u have ever killed an animal you have raised it is very difficult Moving convo ajonous didnt mention organs very much It's kinda sus how there's a channel dedicated to shitting on him Are there court docket filings for his charges Just thinking about it already has me hungry But he also most likely spent a big part of it to pay Ilyas for the x2 arsons and x1 acid attack Expensive airbnbs is my guess Why is he getting so much hate Yeah 4 total.",5,208
4891,He also doesn't remove people from his paid channel after you pay.. Some people are in there after months of not paying recurring payments..

Therefore it will allow the same to happen in the body: debris from cooked foods will be removed efficiently by a similar or identical raw food..

Raw iron binds to toxic iron which allows the body to neutralize it and escort it out.",5,91

Drinking raw celery juice can detoxify past cooked greens (among other things), including cooked plants other than celery that were eaten.. This is a general rule, there can be other rules that are more important to heal a given body tissue:Sometimes the best remedies are not just ""to eat the same thing but raw"".",5,110

5027,"What is difference between salted and unsalted raw cheese?. RULE #6 OF THE PRIMAL DIETDo not eat rock salt.. Salt is a rock, and our body cannot process rocks.. It has a toxic effect, different from the sodium found as a nutrient in plant or animal foods.. Water dissolves rocks, and plants eat rocks, then animals eat plants, and we eat the plants or animals.",5,65
5028,"This for us is food, the minerals are made into nutrients, becoming bio-available.. Rock salt is very different from the sodium found in food.. According to Aajonus, rock salt is an explosive.. Rock salt is a mineral formed from sodium chloride (NaCl).. When eating rock salt, during digestion, the sodium is separated from the chloride, so the sodium ion becomes isolated.",5,61
5029,"Isolated sodium is more volatile than nitroglycerin, this is when it becomes an explosive.. So during digestion and after, this isolated sodium creates micro-explosions in the blood, destroying other nutrients and killing cells.. Additionally, when the isolated sodium doesn't explode right away, it can draw other isolated sodium ions to itself, creating sodium clusters, and the magnetism of them can rip off the guts of cells.. This makes using rock salt the second worst thing next to cooking in standard diet practices.. One million red blood cells are destroyed by one little grain of salt.",5,95
5030,"When part of raw foods, even during digestion, sodium is always bound to other nutrients, they are always connected on a chemical level, it doesn't get isolated and therefore doesn't have this damaging effect.. The body detoxifies the unusable, isolated, form of sodium by sweating it out when possible.. Salt detoxification is major cause of headaches.. What about salt licks?. First of all, herbivores do this, not carnivores.",5,68

They grow into them.. I wouldn’t ever eat none organic anything.. I remember when starting out washing organic celery then a fellow primal pointing out my mistake 👀 vinegar when diluted will not errode the enamel and it helps to dissolve plaque and other garbage every 3 days will be fine Is it good idea to have cooked sweet potato with red meat and raw fat?. i dont think u need to use vinegar everyday Yes.,5,117

They served steak tartar bone marrow and some seafoods Some restaurant that served meat and sold meat to It's really hard to get anything high quality if not by a farmer Where did you buy Not sure if it was in book tho I remember seeing the recipe with le before Did Ajonus specify what if You used lime instead Poultry and fish.,5,128
5090,Pork is a mix.. Lime does the opposite of lemonLemon promotes fermentationLime hinders itYes it tastes nice but it's a different formula and doesn't do the same thingLub formula is made to digest very fast so it rushes the fats to parts of your body that don't receive much nutrition otherwise And everything looks disgusting at the butcher here and shops I was just eating amazing raw meat in Poland but I come back to uk Portal tartare olive oil + dill Yess a lot 20 30 minutes a day I'm tanned This is bad every time I shit I keep going back And I was on and off for like 45 minites Had some crazy diarrhoea once after fasting for 5 days I've had white shit after drinking lots of raw milk 😭 I've been shitting the past 30 minutes Covered in shit My shit looked like brown worms Have you No Has anyone found worms in their shits?.

Not convinced at all , just speculating Who tf prescribes flaxseed oil ahah Which is what they were asking about More tryptophan Is raw turkey better then raw chicken?. Just get raw turkey I dont trust most wild fish So its really the only good alternative unless you spend a lot of money on importing fish from a less contaminated area like alaskan waters And farmed fish is just disgusting But wild fish is mostly full of heavy metals Algae would not be necessary if you ate a lot of wild fish Get fish boy Algae is not food Algae has a lot of omega 3s in it very bioavailable and it doesnt have the chance to be rancid like fish oil If u must get an omega 3 ""supplement"" then just buy algae Seed oil supplements are bad for u they are usually pressed with heat and oxidized Jew Toxic idk if the food itself was being detoxified then I guess it would be pointless to eat it?",5,215
5094,wdym?. Good point but I think back when there werent many people and way more animals in nature people would still consume raw milk when they killed a female herbivore.. Not as much as you could consume today but definitely something.. And yeah probably unlimited water creatures whenever they wanted.. Lots of primitive tribes had no dairy and they probably weren't deficient Also in some seafood like you said but probably not enough Yeah there is calcium in animal fat Just wondering if it's in fat or something but idk “It's estimated that nearly half of the world's population is deficient in calcium.,5,103
5095,"” For Americans, the USDA puts those numbers at around 30 percent of men and 60 percent of women 19 years and up.. Some people in the world didn't have access to dairy so they must have eaten something to not be deficient Better than doing nothong or tryna get rich off crypto Idm I'm going to my 9-5 now Why do you think it's so difficult 😆 Eat a raw beef Idk why ur laughinh lol You can use /wish as a general Wishing Well of sortsFor example:/wish I could date you 😍, or/wish that sushi was 🍣 in /emojify, or/wish I had someone to /cuddle at night.. .. ..

That's 8 hours lost in the day plus travel I can take my butter out the fridge and blend it straight away.,5,103
5098,"I Only do this in summer because the lube turns to liquid if I keep outside of the fridge.. The butter I use blends easily when I take it out of the fridge cold but other butters have a different consistency that's tough to blend I wonder what that depends on It's mostly fat dayum like drinking lube formula That's awesome I want to try that haha Even without mammal milk from some seals or whales they have such high quality food they wouldn't need it But yeah no cows in the arctic ""In some indigenous cultures, such as the Inuit people of the Arctic regions, seal milk is consumed as a traditional food source"" True maybe we don't actually need much calcium if we're healthy the cope is unbelieveable Silly AI Bot No i just meant butter i think if u mix the lube with meat it turns into fuel, rather than their intended purposes No kizzy I eat it in front of my coworkers in the lunch room and redpill them about primal I like to soak some meat in the butter too and bring it to work like the easiest thing to make yeah how do u not have time to make a lube formula But not hot enough to burn u You just put it in a jar and soak it in hot water It takes barely any time Only in very specific scenarios.. Normally we wouldn't eat them at all.. baked or boiled potato is fine i think Nothing cooked Sad to see family members go through the cancer process with chemo and other deadly treatments Are you all eating your potatoes raw or cooked?. oh ok Ok I use aajs garlic butter recipe Lol Least obvious not I'm ok For my gyno hi how are you Could do w that Nice man Mixed a bunch of raw honey and berries in it Has me so calm I ate like a pound of homemade ice cream today Truss true Extremely important Wards off vampires It is it's not a staple food that's for sure Even tho he also said garlic bad at one point I used to but then got lazy 😅 it’s something extra to constantly wash.",5,373

Just really isn't unappealing to me dad bod vibes when you do it properly very aesthetic the good thing about raw fats is, when you put on weight you won't look as bloated as you would on cooked fats butter, milkshakes Without spending crazy money How do I gain weight on this diet You do not detox deep tissue toxicity while being low bodyfat.. The body needs excess fat to start pulling toxins from deep tissue.",5,128

I understand that being at a higher body fat % aids with the detox process a lot, but I'd still reap benefits by still doing PD while remaining at 10% bf?. Also any detox formula, berries, moldy foods, coconut cream are much more dangerous on low bodyfat and constipation may also be frequent.. Yes if you naturally don't get a flu detox that takes out 5-15kg of weight every year or so.",5,109
5105,"Aajonus presented the weight gain and loss cycles in his books but in his latest Q&A's he favored for people to be chubby and gaining all the time since we can't decide when our bodies want to enter a major detoxification, and we would be more protected from industrial toxins around us.. Unless one has had many injections then doing a couple weight loss cycles on their own gets rid off plenty off toxins to kickstart the body's own natural weight loss cycle rhythm.. Also baths are brutal on low bodyfat as Alban pointed out.. Construction.. They just think I'm a madlad and about drinks they joke I have White Russian Cocktail (milk), clear liquor (sparkling mineral water), and vodka infused watermelon with me 😂 I think it's fine but you won't detox as fast and the detox that will occur will be more unpleasant I think one reason to gain fat is for baths Is cycling between being overweight and normal weight really necessary?",5,165

Both are bomb but how does lube taste bad exactly bitter taste, hard to properly blend Any possibility of emfs?. Possibly maybe it's the quality of butter hmm that seems possible, I don't refrigerate it because then it detoxes wayyyy too much Having read this, I think this is why.. Your butter must be fermented or soured, hence giving a bitter ish taste or smth ?. I’ve had same experience with my lube before when my butter was fermented yea 2 eggs 16g honey 113g butter and only 8g of lemon otherwise it doesn't blend properly You use all the ingredients?",5,151

How you gonna do this on a full time job see I don't got time for that shit yupp trust aajonus ratios I don't refrigerate butter tho Also it’s best to kinda melt the butter before blending..

In around 36-48hrs(the time it takes is always different because it depends on the temperature in the house) it will develop into kefir.. Open the jars to release the pressurized air then shake them up every day (ideal but not 100% necessary) you'll just get a bit of natural carbonation forming in the kefir if you don't sometimes which is fine.",5,93
5150,"Open first then shake after.. Keep an eye on them once they get close to the 48 hour mark/once they start tasting more fermented.. I usually take them out of cupboard early and put them in the fridge so it stops the fermenting before it gets over-fermented, if it's over fermented it's still edible usually, just can cause some uncomfortable strong detox.. So I like to take it out early before it goes too far and then if I want it more fermented later I can just put it in the cupboard for a while again..

Whey is basically just soured milk which he says you can use Idk.. Whey and soured milk are different aren't they?. Whey is there when the liquid and solid completely separate whereas sour milk is still one cohesive thing Idk man, there is slight differences between kefir, yogurt, whey and sour milk right.",5,109
5311,"Its all basically the same thing though so, maybe you need the condense minerals in the curds left with the milk to bind with toxins in the bath.. Anyone get a soapy tasting milk occasionally ?. apparently its known phenomenon with all breast milk.. Hormonal detox or something.. Yeah.",5,49

Not as fucked as half a liter of whiskey Since eggs have more protein in them than fat, and protein requires fat to be digested, if you have eggs on their own, or meat on its own, your body will have to use its own fat to digest the protein, so eating proteins on their own will burn fat off the body But Aajonus said when he ate 25 a day on an egg fast he could gain weight?. Should you really listen to your body or is it better to have a peater / Faustian health view where you just stuff down raw foods even if your body is rejecting it because it will heal faster?",5,154
5327,"Can you find where he said that and send?. He had to have been eating other stuff I know a bodybuilder back in the day recommended 36 eggs and like 3 cups of raw cream as a bulking diet He says multiple times that eggs eaten on their own cause weight loss A good dozen eggs are like 10$ a carton The raw cream providing the fat to prevent weight loss IIRC I recall him saying 25 would make him gain, 22 would maintain, and 20 would lose weight Fruit flies are the worst part about this diet by far Idk how there's only 30 search results when searching for it Go inside Fruit flies must have had a field day when Aajonus created this diet.. No other diet makes these scumbags as happy I am inside they invade I close my lid after scooping I'm aging milk to make cheese and all of a sudden they're here Lid is not even open Are u in Alaska?. I feel like God created fruit flies to stop ppl from doing this diet I'm in Canada That's why What do you mean Nothing is ever gonna satisfy your thirst without it you can drink all the milk in the world What makes you say this?.

5329,Minerals 👀 Even a spoonful of butter and honey does the job.. I often do that It's so good Yes Adrian it is 😁 So good too I'm going to have lots more time in a few weeks I'll see how it goes.. I might up the hot water bottle perspiration sesh up to one x a day as well.. If I eat too much primal without enough pers then I get cramps which Aaj explained.. So it's a balancing act for now It’s all a massive puzzle we are trying to put together.,5,94
5330,Thankfully aaj built the puzzle for us to play with.. ☺️🥰 For sure there's definitely a learning curve after the first few months for a lot of people.. Basically can't just eat whatever primal food you want anymore with your body only focused on wanting nutrients it never got its whole life.. Now it's going to be detoxing and you have to let it out.. Been my experience anyway 👀 How long after meat before having milk?,5,77
5331,"2 hours Sucking eggs alone causes weight loss i thought Does it get cold in winter You can drink upto half a cup with meat it will just effect digestion a little Atleast an hour does anyone recall Aajonus talking about an enema alternative using chia seeds?. or whatever the fuck he called it instead of enema he said something like it can do a similar job of lubricating your gut and giving nutrition to starved areas Yes, I’m speaking about In between meals.. I thought eggs have to be mixed with milk or another food or else they'll cause weight loss What is the impact of having time windows between food?. Slower digestion?. If the case is slower digestion does it really matter as it gets digested anyway?",5,129
5332,I eat whatever I want and always sip some milk.. When I have high liver I do wait a bit longer to sip on milk but It’s never over an hour or something like that.. Think it’s because of the toxins constantly being released in my mouth but I always feel like I need to be sipping milk Me to I’m thirsty always Yes green juice is good too.. Also honey and butter as I said Having bone marrow I find helps for me.. Wonder what impact drinking blood would have?,5,91
5333,More fat and more hydration.. Green juice.. Tomato’s and cucumbers.. These will hydrate you You need the celery juice I was always thirsty before I had it idk how I survived I'm been chugging gallons of milk since I'm so thirsty So do you know how long to wait?. TMi This rotten meat tastes horrible but I need more Is that a result of modern times No organic stores online to get it from?,5,74
5334,"But I will attempt to clean it with the whey, lemon and acv but I don’t know if it will be enough?. That literally just described what I’m sufffering the past 6+ months but I’m too scared to do the juicces because all the celery and carrot here is sprayed with pesticides.. Wait just symptoms of toxins building up everywhere in the body basically I don't know what the toxins are, and Aajonus didn't specify.. You can tell by the effects which are:- loss of appetite for meat / fat and even aversion for it- overacidic feeling in the gut / heartburn- increasing lethargy- brainfog- more irritated, anxious- feeling of sluggishness- start to cough more often- with time, worse hair quality, worse teeth quality What toxins does celery juice specifically remove?. And what are the negative side effects I should expect if I carry on dismissing it?",5,147
5335,"From experience celery juice is impossible to avoid when eating exclusively raw animal foods, period.. It's extremely important because there are toxins that only it can remove, otherwise your body just gets damaged constantly and keeps getting worse after a while Aajonus said this, some of the plant toxins going away after 24h.. This is just a side fact anywayCelery is low in oxalates, plants high in oxalates, like spinach, Aajonus wouldn't recommend, because even he said that could give kidney problems.. He was very well aware of plant toxins but he has empirical data, he knows which one is good in which quantity in practice.. Additionally when you juice celery (not blending it by the way), the minerals from within the juice bind to the remaining plant toxins, so they're already neutralized.",5,133
5336,"Someone mentioned here that the plant toxins are gone after 24 hours of it being unrooted, do you think this as well?. Not one plant has less than 60 known carcinogens, do you think this is all destroyed when blended?. usually, yes Should I increase vegetable juicce quantity if I don’t feel the efffects of it , increasing appetitte And if it makes you feel acidic in your gut / heartburn or have diarrhea / headaches at first, it's normal, it can happenJust keep doing and it will go away and you will only feel good from it often on its own sometimes with either of those (+honey) Interesting, do you have it on its own or do you also mix it with cream and eggs such as Adrian?. And these toxins all start dumping and building up because of the acidity in the body from starting to eat raw meat, which is then counteracted by the celery juice which is alkalinising?. not sure but to some extent yeah they dump in great part from eating raw, that lets the body detoxify more, but you need certain foods like raw animal fat and celery juice to help handle those toxins and eliminate them completely out of the body yes, also you probably need a bit more fat in the form of raw butter He didn't explain how it works chemically like he does sometimes, he just stated the effect.",5,239
5337,"Aren't you in the UK?. Plenty of supermarkets offer organic.. That's all he wrote concerning veg juice in the book though On that last part, that doesn't work.. You cannot neutralize all acidity no matter how much lemon, fruits, cheese, etc.. you take.",5,43
5338,"Yes I’d say I eat that amount maybe more to be honest.. My farm is really good quality no vax or anything in that nature.. I’ll leave you alone now since I’ve asked you a lot of questions, thanks for answering me I appreciate it That's not all there is, and combinations matter too.. Eating iron from raspberry isn't the same from eating iron in meat Vitamins?. You can get them in organs.",5,73
5339,Minerals?. Cheese with honey and shellfish.. Enzymes?. Honey and fruit.. Neutralise acidity?,5,12
5340,"Lemons and other fruit.. Aajonus didn't give detailed explanations for this, so we don't really know.. Not reallyIf you manage to eat around 200g then goodI think Aajonus mentioned bone marrow might be a bit hard to digest though?. Also is it only from organic quality to avoid toxins What component isn't replaceable then?. I eat quite a lot of bone marrow a day, you think butter has something I’m missing?",5,71
5341,"He explicitly said only sugar cane juice or unripe papaya juice can replace celery juice, I haven't tried those two but I tried pretty much everything else (lemon, tomato, cucumber, all kinds of fruits), nothing replaces celery juice.. Unfortunately doesn't work that way Everything that is in vegetable juices you can also get in some other way.. What A.. V.. wrote down as diet plan recommendation works in that constellation, that doesn't mean there are other ways.",5,77
5342,"and if it seems difficult to eat more fat celery juice will help with it too Okay so as of right now for animal fat I’m eating bone marrow and I also be getting some from milk.. I eat unsalted cheese as well which is a cheddar but I should add celery juice for me to completely remove toxins?. I know his books are like that a lot, but in most cases he hints at it and if you have a brain you can verify most things he said scientifically.. However in this case there isn't even a hint.. Would lime work the same as lemon for cleaning fruits and vegetables The opposite Rotten meat smells nice to me and I explained the whole neurogenesis thing not doing it again.",5,130

5345,"Aaj gave out different recipes to different people depending on their physiology some added carrot juice, cucumber puree, zucchini, squash, parsley, etc I add an egg or a bit of cream it's needed I've heard to absorb toxins that the juice pulls out The most dangerous thing on PD It probably will but we can @leclayrom can we have a high egg with tomatoes?.

Not all of it is in one place but he said those things Aajonus said how important celery juice is and how only sugar cane or unripe papaya can replace it What speculation But that's just your speculation and not something he wrote down?",5,223
5348,"I don't think it's necessarily a single nutrient or type of nutrient, combinations of nutrients can act differently No but they supply minerals but minerals in plant foods can act different than in animal foods, they can be more on the detoxification side Yes, and oysters don't work for what celery juice does lol 1 cup of celery contains 81 mg of sodium whereas 1 cup of oysters contains 523 mg He also mentions how if eating a lot of raw eggs you need to drink green juice because it provides non-heme iron (from memory) The other thing is how he calls it ""green juice"".. And in some remedies he says to use green juice, which can even be spinach juice (in small amounts)So maybe it's something about those green foodsThe only known replacements given by Aajonus are also green: sugar cane and unripe papaya (which is mostly green) However it probably isn't the sodium content alone that does it, eating endless amounts of tomatoes doesn't do the same as celery juice Celery cleans the blood and there is a relationship with the blood here and all of this is just trying to figure out why but as I mentioned he didn't explain it in detail and there are only hints at most This speculation That's not speculation, Aajonus mentioned how plant foods are more detoxifying and animal foods are more balanced The minerals in animal foods can build the body, they can't from plants Pickets in support of Pavel Durov are being held around the world at French embassiesProtests in support of the Telegram founder have already taken place in Russia, Armenia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland and Vietnam..

Petri-dish science doesn't work in the body Has nothing to do with healthy raw meat Yeah exactly and then bacteria grows on the cooked toxic meat and consumes the toxic material I assumed that the bacteria gets killed during the cooking process I assumed that endotoxins only form after healthy bacteria consumes toxic material ie carcinogenic black crust from cooked meat.. Then someone eats it and gets sick It can have if it's not coming from a 100% healthy animal..

And pull more bitches Also they almost always quit after a while Saladino and most of the carnivore community started calling their diet animal based to cope because they all eat a bunch of fruit and honey now I have huge respect for aajonus, doesn’t mean I agree with him saying to consume vegetables Its because their blood gets too acidic on carnivore thats why carnivores are always angry like u are rn The body generates new ones because the plants killed them all..

5375,But your body produces 200 billion red blood cells a day on average which is 1.. 3 tablespoons of RBC.. The RBC concentration of blood is approximately 45% of the blood.. Meaning if you lose 1.. 5 tablespoons of blood every hour you are losing 0.,5,46
5376,7 tablespoons of red blood cells an hour.. So in 6 hours you lose 4.. 2 tablespoons of red blood cells which is about 600 billion red blood cells.. The most extreme cases the body could potentially produce a trillion red blood cells a day.. TLDR So on average for 6 hours the body produces 50 billion RBC.,5,58
5377,But Aajonus is saying that you would lose 600 billion RBC from fasting for 6 hours..

You will benefit from an eating window of up to 30 minutes without toxins dumping into the gut.",5,136
5402,"Raw unsalted cheese very efficiently absorbs the many toxins that the body deposits in the gut, which enables painless detoxification, and to improve digestion significantly.. Aajonus discovered that raw unsalted cheese doesn't digest, but instead absorbs toxins very efficiently.. For almost everyone, many toxins store in the gut.. Since the stomach is very resilient and contains digestive acids, the body deposits toxins there, where the acids can neutralize them.. This also gives a chance for the toxins to get eliminated from the body by being carried away with the food going through.",5,92
5403,"However, most foods end up getting damaged and contaminated by the toxins that the body dumps in the gut, and many of those toxins end up being ""recycled"", stored back into the body.. When eating raw unsalted cheese, the cheese, if truly raw and with no added salt, draws the toxins to itself and neutralizes them with its concentrated minerals and fats.. Therefore, eat a piece of cheese (around half a teaspoon to a teaspoon) 10 minutes before you eat any other foods (whether solid or liquid, even water).. When you first eat a piece of cheese, it will go and collect the toxins, clearing the way for the food that you want to eat next.. This improves digestion significantly (making it around twice better), and appetite.",5,127
5404,"Wait at least 10 minutes after eating that piece of cheese, no more toxins will be dumped in the body for up to 30 minutes, so you can eat without your food encountering toxins, and get improved digestion.. If you eat before the 10 minutes have passed since eating the piece of cheese, the body will deposit more toxins in the gut, but it will still be less than if you didn't eat any cheese at all before.. The total duration of this ""toxin-dumping"" cycle that is reset by the cheese is of 40 minutes (similar to the duration of REM sleep cycles).. https://www.. instagram.",5,105

So during digestion and after, this isolated sodium creates micro-explosions in the blood, destroying other nutrients and killing cells.. Additionally, when the isolated sodium doesn't explode right away, it can draw other isolated sodium ions to itself, creating sodium clusters, and the magnetism of them can rip off the guts of cells.. This makes using rock salt the second worst thing next to cooking in standard diet practices.. One million red blood cells are destroyed by one little grain of salt.",5,95

Aajonus recommends eating raw animal protein (and accompanying raw fat) at least every 5h, that can be: raw eggs, raw meat, raw milk, or a combination (e.. g.. raw milkshake).. That is to prevent being in a state of autophagy.",5,109

After as little as 5h, or even 4, 3, 2 hours, depending on the person, all those proteins in the blood are gone.. This is caused by our toxicity, and what Aajonus called mutant antibodies.. The toxins damage the protein nutrients in our blood stream.",5,71
5475,"The mutant antibodies are created in reaction to vaccines, and behave abnormally: they break down healthy protein, wasting it.. This is why healthy specimens that have lived in very good environments (such as non-polluted nature) are not affected by this, they can fast, they will not be protein-deficient after only a few hours.. What happens for us is that when our body runs out of protein because of toxicity, it has to cannibalize its own red blood cells to generate protein, which both weakens our body and makes it consume its own toxicity, since our bodies are at all times discarding stored toxicity, so eating our own tissues exposes us to more damage from our toxicity.. Aajonus recommends to wake up at night to eat raw animal protein within less than 5 hours since the last time raw animal protein was eaten, even if that involves using an alarm clock!. This may seem forced, but it gives much better quality sleep, as the body gets plenty of nutrients to heal, grow, remove its toxicity with less side-effects, etc.",5,178

All they do is take a metal dental scraper tool and scrape the plaque off and rinse with water.. No chemicals.. Don't they use bad chemicals Go to the dentist if you have a lot of plaque on your teeth and get them to scrape it off For me, Apple cider vinegar removed a bit of plaque but it also demineralizes the teeth and the rest of the body so you have to be disciplined and not have too much of it or it will eat away the dentine layer of your teeth and you have to eat lots of raw cheese+raw honey combo if you have apple cider vinegar so that you're providing minerals to counteract the effect of the vinegar.",5,180

Helping to rebuild damaged tissues: Electrolytes, including potassium, calcium, and magnesium, are involved in tissue repair and regeneration.. Common electrolytes include:Sodium (Na+)Potassium (K+)Calcium (Ca2+)Magnesium (Mg2+)Chloride (Cl-)Bicarbonate (HCO3-)Phosphate (PO4^3-) I would suggest to get salt as easiest way to get electrolytes but I would be cursed it this communiity soon for that 🌚 Tomatoes and cucumbers Is lemon electrolytes M How do I buy electrolytes in a shop Bro but which electrolytes All food has electrolytes.",5,134

When I let my raw cream within a plastic container, the taste becomes awful near the expiration date, whereas when I put the raw cream in a glass container, it tastes good indefinetly.. I don't whether it's due to bacteria breaking down the plastic (in which case, leaving food outside the fridge would worsen this problem), or just the plastic leaking into the food without any involvement of bacteria (in which case, leaving food outside the fridge would not worsen this problem), but anyways, this difference between plastic and glass containers seem to have important consequences regarding the durability of the raw cream..

Like wtf It's cleaning you out man 😄 It's mostly you who's hard to find not cheese 😂😂 So what’s the point of recirculating the toxins?,5,101
5667,The toxins need to be removed from the body Yes Aajonus talks about how we recirculate and re-digest the toxins in our body unless we detox them out.. It's the whole reason why he has so many detoxification protocols like raw unsalted cheese and bathes There are ways to excrete them why reabsorbing.. I just refuse to believe I’m suffering for nothing and poisoning myself with painkillers for nothing That’s what Aajonus said?. Someone said he suggested the opposite-the toxins are neutralized so they’re no danger.. It just doesn’t make sense to damage the body detoxing the toxins back As far as I know it gets reabsorbed everywhere.,5,108
5668,"Especially during digestion of course.. We recirculate and re-digest a lot of the poisons unless we detox them out.. I think that if the body has a huge amount of toxins that it needs to get rid of that's when diarrhea is triggered but the body also wants to digest nutrients so it's not going to diarrhea and get rid of everything unless it absolutely feels it has to.. That's my assumption Maybe it just transports it in a better place idk Just for eating that much watermelon Tomorrow I will also buy watermelon and make sports formula, a friend gave me a recipe for formula with the addition of watermelon berries etc and it was uuuu mmmm fiu fiu fiu fiu I had 10kg of watermelon in 2 days and my stomach was hurting all day yesterday Stomach pain, toxins..

I don't understand what you mean..

Then during my 8 months recovery she was slowly removing blocks which in turn expanded skull and returned my bones back to their original position..

He recommends plenty of acidic foods for their benefits.",5,160
5820,"However a high presence of minerals will lead to more alkalinity and more minerals is good in general Aged urine is hardly toxic.. Urine is a distilled water that is highly negatively charged.. Aged urine is also alkaline and thus has the same benefits of alkaline water..

Just like the idea that bacteria and parasites are bad for us Thats great Aajonus claims he and some of his clients did, we have yet to see that drastic a transformation more recently though Maybe it can't fully, the reason being the blood is not supposed to transport as many nutrients as it does in the first place so it is probably not equipped to save them when making urine Is there anyone that has actually gotten blue eyes from the diet?. It could be the nutrient part yes, but I tend to think the body won't get rid of nutrients that are still usable, especially during a fast when there is scarcity of resources.. The body is probably smart enough to only discard unusable things through urine.. I agree that drinking urine will probably prevent some detox since it limits one pathway It could also be from him simply getting nutrients by recycling them whereas in a water fast he is just depleting himself I think the body will detox less overall if you drink urine, this retoxify so this stops symptoms.",5,205
5827,"Aajonus mentionned in an interview that he did once a 40 days fast while drinking urine and felt better than during shorter fasts where he did not drink urine.. I think the explanation is because the urine prevented him from detoxing.. but you know you can do lab tests on all these things, so you can find out rather easily In addition to that you have Aajonus mentioning that if you drink your urine, the body will detox less through itThat still doesn't prevent the morning urine from being the most toxic by far Urine is one of the main detox pathway.. If anything, someone who follows the primal diet will detoxify more and have a more toxic urine than someone following a cooked diet..
